1
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:15,761
Just tell me what happened
from the beginning.

2
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:17,841
We had been to a bar.

3
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:23,321
Nice place, and, er, I got chatting
with one of the waitresses...

4
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:26,361
...and Karen weren't happy
with that, so...

5
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:30,721
When we get back to the hotel, we end up
having a bit of a ding-dong, don't we?

6
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:36,601
She's always getting at me,
saying I weren't a real man.

7
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:38,041
Wasn't a real man.

8
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:42,401
- What?
- It's not "weren't", it's "wasn't".

9
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:44,081
Oh.

10
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,161
Go on.

11
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:54,921
Well... then I don't know how it happened,
but suddenly there's a knife in my hands...

12
00:00:56,161 --> 00:01:00,241
...and you know me old man was a butcher,
so I know how to handle knives.

13
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,921
- He learned us how to cut up a beast.
- Taught.

14
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,201
- What?
- Taught you how to cut up a beast.

15
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:07,921
- Yeah, well, then I done it.
- Did it.

16
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,521
Did it! Stabbed her!

17
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:13,801
Over and over and over,
and I looked down, and she weren't...

18
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:16,921
...wasn't...

19
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:19,081
...moving no more.

20
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,161
Any more.

21
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:30,241
God help me, I dunno how it happened,
but it was an accident, I swear.

22
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:33,481
Eh, you've gotta help me,
Mr Holmes!

23
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:37,401
Everyone says you're the best.
Without you...

24
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:39,441
...I'll get hung for this.

25
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:41,601
No, not at all,
Mr Bewick.

26
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:45,041
Hanged, yes.

27
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:50,241
What the hell
are you doing?

28
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:51,721
- Bored.
- What?

29
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:53,601
- Bored!
- No...

30
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:56,321
Bored! Bored!

31
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:01,361
Don't know what's got into
the criminal classes.

32
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:04,681
- Good job I'm not one of them.
- So you take it out on the wall?

33
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:07,041
The wall had it coming.

34
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:13,921
- What about that Russian case?
- Belarus?

35
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:17,081
Open and shut domestic murder.
Not worth my time.

36
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:18,681
Oh, shame.

37
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:24,801
Anything in?
I'm starving.

38
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,321
Oh, f...

39
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:36,561
There's a head.

40
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,801
- A severed head!
- Just tea for me, thanks.

41
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:41,721
- No, there's a head in the fridge.
- Yes?

42
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:42,921
A bloody head!

43
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:45,681
Where else was I supposed to put it?
You don't mind, do you?

44
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:48,841
- Well...
- Got it from Bart's morgue.

45
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:52,361
I'm measuring the coagulation
of saliva after death.

46
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,521
I see you've written up
the taxi driver case.

47
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,201
Er... yes.

48
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:59,001
"A Study In Pink".
Nice.

49
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:03,081
Well, you know.
Pink lady, pink case, pink phone.

50
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:06,041
There was a lot of pink.
Did you like it?

51
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:09,881
- Um... no.
- Why not? I thought you'd be flattered.

52
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:13,201
Flattered? "Sherlock sees through
everything and everyone in seconds.

53
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:16,641
What's incredible, though, is how specta-
cularly ignorant he is about some things."

54
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,081
Hang on a minute,
I didn't mean that...

55
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:20,441
Oh, you meant "spectacularly ignorant"
in a nice way.

56
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:23,201
Look, it doesn't matter to me
who's Prime Minister...

57
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:25,401
- Yeah, I know.
- ...or who's sleeping with who...

58
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,601
- Whether the earth goes round the sun.
- Not that again! It's not important!

59
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:30,001
Not impor...?

60
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:33,361
It's primary school stuff.
How can you not know that?

61
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:36,121
- Well, if I ever did, I've deleted it.
- Deleted it?

62
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:40,841
Listen. This is my hard drive,
and it only makes sense...

63
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:45,281
...to put things in there
that are useful. Really useful.

64
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:48,081
Ordinary people fill their heads
with all kinds of rubbish.

65
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:51,681
That makes it hard to get at
the stuff that matters. Do you see?

66
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,041
- But it's the solar system!
- Oh, hell! What does that matter?

67
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:57,881
So we go round the sun.
If we went round the moon...

68
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:01,761
...or round and round the garden like a teddy
bear, it wouldn't make any difference!

69
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:07,321
All that matters to me is the work!
Without that, my brain rots!

70
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:08,681
Put that in your blog!

71
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:12,281
Or, better still, stop inflicting
your opinions on the world!

72
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:23,241
- Where are you going?
- Out! I need some air.

73
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,041
Oh, sorry, love!

74
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,441
Woo-hoo!

75
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:32,401
Have you two had
a little domestic?

76
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:42,201
It's a bit nippy out there.

77
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:45,521
He should have wrapped himself up
a bit more.

78
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:51,121
Look at that,
Mrs Hudson.

79
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:53,601
Quiet.

80
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:56,561
Calm. Peaceful.

81
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:01,721
- Isn't it hateful?
- I'm sure something will turn up, Sherlock.

82
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:05,601
A nice murder.
That'll cheer you up.

83
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,561
- Can't come too soon.
- Hey!

84
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:11,401
What have you done
to my bloody wall?

85
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:14,841
I'm putting this on your rent,
young man!

86
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:28,001
- Morning.
- Oh, mo... morning.

87
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:29,801
See, told you
you should have gone with the Lilo.

88
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:34,441
No, no, no, it's fine, I slept fine.
It's very kind of you.

89
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:40,001
Well, maybe next time I'll let you kip
at the end of my bed, you know.

90
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,001
...which was discovered
quietly mouldering...

91
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:45,121
- What about the time after that?
- ...18 months ago.

92
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:49,201
Experts are hailing it as the artistic find
of the century and no-one...

93
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:50,961
- So, do you want some breakfast?
- Love some.

94
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,241
You'd better make it yourself
because I'm going to have a shower.

95
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:56,161
It fetched over £20 million.

96
00:06:56,241 --> 00:07:01,761
This one is anticipated to do even better.
Back now to our main story.

97
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:05,161
There has been a massive explosion
in central London.

98
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:08,761
As yet, there are no reports of any casualties
and the police are unable to say...

99
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:12,601
...if there's any suspicion
of terrorist involvement.

100
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:15,361
- Sarah!
- Police have issued an emergency number...

101
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:18,721
Sarah!
Sorry! I've got to run!

102
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:27,121
Excuse me, can I get through?
Excuse me. Can I get through?

103
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,041
I live over there.

104
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:42,561
Sherlock!

105
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,441
Sherlock!

106
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:50,761
John.

107
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:55,241
- I saw it on the telly. Are you OK?
- Me? What? Oh, yeah, fine.

108
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:57,361
Gas leak, apparently.

109
00:07:58,001 --> 00:07:59,921
- I can't.
- Can't?

110
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:02,761
Stuff I've got on is just too big.
I can't spare the time.

111
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:06,801
Never mind your usual trivia.
This is of national importance.

112
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:09,441
How's the diet?

113
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:11,241
Fine.

114
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:13,841
- Perhaps you can get through to him, John?
- What?

115
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:16,761
I'm afraid my brother
can be very intransigent.

116
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:18,361
If you're so keen,
why don't you investigate it?

117
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:21,761
No, no, no, no, no. I can't possibly be away
from the office for any length of time.

118
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:24,161
Not with the
Korean elections so...

119
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:27,521
Well, you don't need to know
about that, do you?

120
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:30,921
Besides, a case like this,
it requires...

121
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:32,441
...legwork.

122
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:39,001
- How's Sarah, John? How was the Lilo?
- Sofa, Sherlock. It was the sofa.

123
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:42,121
- Oh, yes, of course.
- How...? Oh, never mind.

124
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:48,241
Sherlock's business seems to be booming
since you and he became... pals.

125
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,801
What's he like to live with?
Hellish, I imagine.

126
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:53,801
- I'm never bored.
- Good. That's good, isn't it?

127
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:06,681
Andrew West, known as Westie
to his friends. Civil servant.

128
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:11,681
Found dead on the tracks at Battersea station
this morning with his head smashed in.

129
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:16,001
- Jumped in front of a train?
- Seems the logical assumption.

130
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:18,801
- But?
- But?

131
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:21,561
Well, you wouldn't be here
if it was just an accident.

132
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:25,361
The MoD is working on
a new missile defence system...

133
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,881
...the Bruce-Partington Program,
it's called.

134
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:31,521
- The plans for it were on a memory stick.
- That wasn't very clever.

135
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:34,601
- It's not the only copy.
- No.

136
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:37,321
But it is secret.
And missing.

137
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:39,681
- Top secret?
- Very.

138
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,161
We think West must have taken
the memory stick.

139
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:44,481
We can't possibly risk it
falling into the wrong hands.

140
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:47,321
You've got to find
those plans, Sherlock.

141
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:49,521
Don't make me order you.

142
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,481
I'd like to see you try.

143
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:55,001
Think it over.

144
00:09:56,321 --> 00:09:58,041
Goodbye, John.

145
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:00,481
See you very soon.

146
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,241
Why did you lie?

147
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:22,601
You've got nothing on. Not a single case.
That's why the wall took a pounding.

148
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:25,121
Why did you tell your brother
you were busy?

149
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:27,681
- Why shouldn't I?
- Oh.

150
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:29,961
Nice.

151
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:34,281
Sibling rivalry.
Now we're getting somewhere.

152
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:42,001
Sherlock Holmes.

153
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:47,081
Of course.
How can I refuse?

154
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:50,241
Lestrade - I've been summoned.
Coming?

155
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:53,041
- If you want me to.
- Of course.

156
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:57,001
I'd be lost
without my blogger.

157
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:17,601
You like the funny cases, don't you?
The surprising ones.

158
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:20,361
- Obviously.
- You'll love this.

159
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:22,561
- That explosion.
- Gas leak, yes?

160
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:23,801
- No.
- No?

161
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:25,641
- No. Made to look like one.
- What?

162
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:28,761
Hardly anything left of the place,
except a strongbox.

163
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:31,321
A very strong box,
and inside it was this.

164
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,041
- You haven't opened it?
- It's addressed to you, isn't it?

165
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:35,841
We've X-rayed it.
It's not booby-trapped.

166
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:37,481
How reassuring.

167
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,041
Nice stationery.

168
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:52,201
- Bohemian.
- What?

169
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:56,761
- From the Czech Republic. No fingerprints?
- No.

170
00:11:57,441 --> 00:12:00,521
She used a fountain pen.
Parker Duofold, Meridian nib.

171
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,361
- She?
- Obviously.

172
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:04,961
Obviously.

173
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,401
That... That's the phone.
The pink phone.

174
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:24,201
What,
from The Study In Pink?

175
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:27,441
Well, obviously, it's not the same phone,
but it's supposed to look like...

176
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:31,241
- Study In Pink, you read his blog?
- Of course I read his blog. We all do.

177
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:35,121
Do you really not know that
the Earth goes round the sun?

178
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:39,761
It isn't the same phone.

179
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:41,601
This one's brand new.

180
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:44,521
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble
to make it look like the same phone.

181
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:48,561
Which means your blog
has a far wider readership.

182
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,561
You have
one new message.

183
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:01,441
- Was that it?
- No, that's not it.

184
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,161
What in the hell
are we supposed to make of that?

185
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:11,321
An estate agent's photo
and the bloody Greenwich pips.

186
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:14,041
- It's a warning.
- A warning?

187
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:18,641
Some secret societies used to send
dried melon seeds, orange pips...

188
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:21,561
...things like that -
five pips.

189
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,401
They're warning us
it's going to happen again.

190
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,881
- I've seen this place before.
- Hang on.

191
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:30,441
- What's going to happen again?
- Boom!

192
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:53,001
Mrs Hudson?

193
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:59,641
You had a look, didn't you, Sherlock,
when you first came to see about your flat?

194
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:03,321
- The door's been opened. Recently.
- No, can't be. That's the only key.

195
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,881
I can't get anyone interested
in this flat.

196
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:09,641
It's the damp, I expect -
that's the curse of basements.

197
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:13,761
I'd a place once when I was first married.
Black mould all up the wall...

198
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,721
Oh. Dear me.

199
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,521
Shoes.

200
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:40,201
He's a bomber,
remember.

201
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:05,761
Hello.

202
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:11,041
H-Hello...

203
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:13,841
...sexy.

204
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:16,321
Who's this?

205
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:18,281
I've...

206
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:21,921
...sent you...
a little puzzle.

207
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,721
Just to say hi.

208
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:30,321
Who's talking?
Why are you crying?

209
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:34,241
I... I'm not crying.

210
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:36,561
I'm typing.

211
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:39,681
And this...

212
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:43,121
...stupid bitch...

213
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,721
...is reading it out.

214
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,081
The curtain rises.

215
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,001
- What?
- Nothing.

216
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:57,161
- No, what did you mean?
- I've been expecting this for some time.

217
00:15:57,241 --> 00:16:00,561
12 hours to solve...

218
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,281
...my puzzle, Sherlock.

219
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:09,481
Or I'm going to be...

220
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:13,361
...so... naughty.

221
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:50,121
So, who do you suppose
it was?

222
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:52,561
Woman on the phone -
the crying woman.

223
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,921
Oh, she doesn't matter,
she's just a hostage. No lead there.

224
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:58,041
For God's sake,
I wasn't thinking about leads.

225
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:00,641
You're not going
to be much use to her.

226
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,601
Are they trying to trace it -
trace the call?

227
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:07,241
The bomber's too smart for that.
Pass me my phone.

228
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:09,881
- Where is it?
- Jacket.

229
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:20,521
Careful!

230
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,121
- Text from your brother.
- Delete it.

231
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:30,401
- Delete it?
- Missile plans are out of the country now.

232
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:33,521
- Nothing we can do about it.
- Well, Mycroft thinks there is.

233
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,641
He's texted you eight times.
Must be important.

234
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,601
Then why didn't he cancel
his dental appointment?

235
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,121
- His what?
- Mycroft never texts if he can talk.

236
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:42,641
Look, Andrew West stole the missile plans,
tried to sell them...

237
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:45,441
...got his head smashed in for his pains,
end of story.

238
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:47,761
The only mystery is this - why's my
brother so determined to bore me...

239
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:50,241
...when somebody else
is being so delightfully interesting?

240
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:52,001
Try and remember
there's a woman who might die.

241
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:56,041
What for? There's hospitals
full of people dying, Doctor.

242
00:17:56,121 --> 00:18:00,001
Why don't you go and cry by their bedside
and see what good it does them?

243
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,361
Ah!

244
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:05,281
- Any luck?
- Oh, yes!

245
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:09,841
- Oh, sorry. I didn't...
- Jim, hi!

246
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:12,001
Come in! Come in!

247
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:15,681
Jim, this is
Sherlock Holmes.

248
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,161
- Ah.
- And, er...

249
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:21,921
- Sorry.
- John Watson. Hi.

250
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,961
Hi. So, you're
Sherlock Holmes.

251
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:29,401
Molly's told me all about you.
You on one of your cases?

252
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:34,801
Jim works in IT, upstairs.
That's how we met. Office romance.

253
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:37,201
- Gay.
- Sorry, what?

254
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,321
Nothing. Um, hey.

255
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,001
Hi.

256
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:42,681
Sorry. Sorry!

257
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:47,161
Well, I'd better be off.

258
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:50,361
- I'll see you at the Fox. About sixish?
- Yeah.

259
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:51,681
- Bye.
- Bye.

260
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,081
It was nice to meet you.

261
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,401
You too.

262
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:07,281
What do you mean, gay?
We're together.

263
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:09,161
And domestic bliss
must suit you, Molly.

264
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:11,161
You've put on three pounds
since I last saw you.

265
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:12,761
- Two-and-a-half.
- No, three.

266
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,921
- Sherlock.
- He's not gay!

267
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:18,561
- Why do you have to spoil...? He's not!
- With that level of personal grooming?

268
00:19:18,641 --> 00:19:21,641
Because he puts a bit of product in
his hair? I put product in my hair.

269
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,081
You wash your hair,
there's a difference.

270
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:26,681
No, no - tinted eyelashes, clear signs
of taurine cream around the frown lines.

271
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:29,441
Those tired, clubber's eyes.
Then there's his underwear.

272
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:31,641
- His underwear?
- Visible above the waistline.

273
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:33,481
Very visible.
Very particular brand.

274
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:37,321
Plus the extremely suggestive fact that
he just left his number under this dish.

275
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:41,401
I'd say you'd better break it off now
and save yourself the pain.

276
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:48,801
- Charming, well done.
- Just saving her time. Isn't that kinder?

277
00:19:48,881 --> 00:19:52,041
Kinder? No, no.
Sherlock, that wasn't kind.

278
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,241
Go on, then.

279
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:00,601
You know what I do.
Off you go.

280
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:02,041
- No.
- Go on.

281
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:04,481
I'm not going to stand here
so you can humiliate me while I try and...

282
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:07,041
An outside eye, a second opinion.
It's very useful to me.

283
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:09,201
- Yeah, right.
- Really!

284
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:14,961
Fine.

285
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:23,081
- Oh, they're just a pair of shoes. Trainers!
- Good.

286
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,161
Um...

287
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:30,281
They're in good nick.
I'd say they were pretty new...

288
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:35,081
...except the sole has been well worn, so
the owner must have had them for a while.

289
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,241
Er, very '80s.
Probably one of those retro designs.

290
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:41,201
You're on sparkling form.
What else?

291
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,721
They're quite big.
A man's.

292
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,281
But...

293
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:50,481
But there's traces of a name
inside in felt-tip.

294
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:56,121
Adults don't write their names inside
their shoes, so these belong to a kid.

295
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,201
Excellent. What else?

296
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:02,921
- Er... That's it.
- That's it.

297
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:06,921
- How did I do?
- Well, John. Really well.

298
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:10,841
I mean, you missed almost everything
of importance, but, you know...

299
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:14,161
The owner loved these.
Scrubbed them clean.

300
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:18,321
Whitened them where they got discoloured.
Changed the laces three... no, four times.

301
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:19,961
Even so, there are traces
of his flaky skin...

302
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,121
...where his fingers have come into contact
with them, so he suffered from eczema.

303
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:24,801
The shoes are well worn,
more so on the inner side...

304
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,761
...which means
the owner had weak arches.

305
00:21:26,841 --> 00:21:29,641
- British-made, 20 years old.
- 20 years?

306
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:33,561
They're not retro, they're original.
Limited edition - two blue stripes, 1989.

307
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:38,641
- There's still mud on them. They look new.
- Someone's kept them that way.

308
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,081
Quite a bit of mud caked
on the soles.

309
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:44,201
Analysis shows it's from Sussex
with London mud overlaying it.

310
00:21:44,281 --> 00:21:45,521
- How do you know?
- Pollen.

311
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:48,001
Clear as a map reference to me.
South of the river, too.

312
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:51,121
So, the kid who owned these trainers
came to London from Sussex 20 years ago...

313
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:53,281
- ...and left them behind.
- So, what happened to him?

314
00:21:53,361 --> 00:21:54,921
Something bad.

315
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:57,601
He loved those shoes, remember.
He'd never leave them filthy.

316
00:21:57,681 --> 00:22:00,201
Wouldn't let them go
unless he had to.

317
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:03,081
So, a child
with big feet gets...

318
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:06,961
Oh!

319
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:10,961
- What?
- Carl Powers.

320
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:12,481
Sorry, who?

321
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:16,241
Carl Powers, John.

322
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:19,081
What is it?

323
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:21,441
It's where I began.

324
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:27,041
1989, young kid,
champion swimmer...

325
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:30,081
...came up from Brighton for a school
sports tournament, drowned in the pool.

326
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:32,641
Tragic accident. You wouldn't remember it.
Why should you?

327
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:34,041
- But you remember.
- Yes.

328
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,841
- Something fishy about it?
- Nobody thought so.

329
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:38,681
Nobody except me.

330
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:41,521
I was only a kid myself.
I read about it in the papers.

331
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:42,761
You started young,
didn't you?

332
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:45,761
The boy, Carl Powers,
had some kind of fit in the water...

333
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:47,961
...but by the time they got him out,
it was too late.

334
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,441
There was something wrong somewhere
and I couldn't get it out of my head.

335
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:53,161
- What?
- His shoes.

336
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:55,601
- What about them?
- They weren't there. I made a fuss.

337
00:22:55,681 --> 00:23:00,001
I tried to get the police interested but
nobody seemed to think it was important.

338
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:02,561
He'd left all the rest of his clothes
in his locker.

339
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:05,241
But there was no sign
of his shoes.

340
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:08,721
Until now.

341
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:42,121
Can I help?

342
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:46,121
I want to help.
There's only five hours left.

343
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:52,281
It's your brother.
He's texting me now.

344
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,881
- How does he know my number?
- Must be a root canal.

345
00:23:57,041 --> 00:24:00,961
Look, he did say...
national importance.

346
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,361
- How quaint!
- What is?

347
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,121
You are...
Queen and country.

348
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:09,121
- You can't just ignore it.
- I'm not ignoring it.

349
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:11,761
Putting my best man
onto it right now.

350
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:14,321
Right, good!

351
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:16,441
Who's that?

352
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:23,041
John, how nice! I was hoping
it wouldn't be long. How can I help you?

353
00:24:24,121 --> 00:24:27,721
Thank you.
Um, I was wanting to...

354
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:34,521
Your brother sent me to collect more facts
about the stolen plans - the missile plans.

355
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:36,961
- Did he?
- Yes.

356
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:40,681
He's investigating now.
He's, er...

357
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:43,401
...investigating away.

358
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,321
I just wondered what else
you could tell me about the dead man.

359
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:51,241
Er, 27.
Clerk at Vauxhall Cross.

360
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:52,641
MI6.

361
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:56,361
He was involved in the Bruce-Partington
Program in a minor capacity.

362
00:24:56,441 --> 00:25:01,161
Security checks A-OK. No known
terrorist affiliations or sympathies.

363
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:05,881
Last seen by his fiancée
10.30 yesterday evening.

364
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:08,321
Lucy, love,
I've got to go out.

365
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,441
I've got to see someone.

366
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:13,241
Westie!

367
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:17,681
He was found at Battersea, yes.
So he got on the train?

368
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:20,241
- No.
- What?

369
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:22,681
He had an Oyster card...

370
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:26,041
...but it hadn't been used.

371
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:28,161
He must have bought
a ticket.

372
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,161
- There was no ticket on the body.
- Then...

373
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:34,321
Then how did he end up with a bashed-in
brain on the tracks at Battersea?

374
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:39,321
That is the question - the one I was rather
hoping Sherlock would provide an answer to.

375
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:40,641
How's he getting on?

376
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:43,521
He's fine, yes.

377
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:49,521
And it is going... very well.
He's, um... He's completely focused on it.

378
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,241
- Poison!
- What are you going on about?

379
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,481
Clostridium botulinum.

380
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:09,561
It's one of the deadliest poisons
on the planet.

381
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:11,361
Carl Powers.

382
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:14,361
Are you saying
he was murdered?

383
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:18,201
Remember the shoelaces...
The boy suffered from eczema.

384
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:21,641
It would be the easiest thing in the world
to introduce the poison into his medication.

385
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:24,641
Two hours later he comes up to London,
the poison takes effect...

386
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:26,481
...paralyses the muscles
and he drowns.

387
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:29,481
- How come the autopsy didn't pick that up?
- It's virtually undetectable.

388
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:31,281
Nobody would have been
looking for it.

389
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:35,681
There's still tiny traces of it
left inside the trainers...

390
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,601
...from where he put
the cream on his feet.

391
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:42,201
- That's why they had to go.
- So, how do we let the bomber know?

392
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:45,641
Get his attention,
stop the clock.

393
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:49,561
- The killer kept the shoes all these years.
- Yes.

394
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:52,841
- Meaning...
- He's our bomber.

395
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:01,961
Well done, you.

396
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:06,041
Come and get me.

397
00:27:07,121 --> 00:27:10,521
Where are you?
Tell us where you are.

398
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,001
She lives in Cornwall.

399
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:23,441
Two men broke in wearing masks,
forced her to drive to the car park...

400
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:27,561
...and decked her out in enough explosives
to take down a house.

401
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:29,481
Told her to phone you.

402
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:32,641
Check the read-out
from this... pager.

403
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:35,841
If she deviated by one word,
the sniper would set her off.

404
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:40,481
- Or if you hadn't solved the case.
- Oh... Elegant!

405
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:43,681
- Elegant?
- What was the point?

406
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:45,441
Why would anyone do this?

407
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:50,921
Oh... I can't be the only person
in the world that gets bored.

408
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:58,641
You have
one new message.

409
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:06,681
- Four pips.
- First test passed, it would seem.

410
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:08,561
Here's the second.

411
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:15,321
- It's abandoned, wouldn't you say?
- I'll see if it's been reported.

412
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:18,161
Freak... it's for you.

413
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,201
Hello.

414
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:28,321
It's OK that you've gone
to the police.

415
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:30,001
Who is this?

416
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:31,721
Is this you again?

417
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:34,041
But don't rely on them.

418
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,321
Clever you.

419
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,401
Guessing about
Carl Powers.

420
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:43,561
I never liked him.

421
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,601
Carl laughed at me...

422
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:51,281
...so I stopped him laughing.

423
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:56,001
You've stolen another voice,
I presume.

424
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:58,721
This is about you and me.

425
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:01,921
Who are you?

426
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:05,041
What's that noise?

427
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:09,001
It's the sounds of life,
Sherlock.

428
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:16,241
But don't worry.
I can soon fix that.

429
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:23,321
You solved my last puzzle
in nine hours.

430
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:26,601
This time you have eight.

431
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,161
Great!

432
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:33,961
We've found it.

433
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:53,241
The car was hired yesterday morning
by an Ian Monkford.

434
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:56,281
Banker of some kind.
City boy. Paid in cash.

435
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,401
Told his wife he was going away
on a business trip and he never arrived.

436
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:02,401
- You're still hanging round him.
- Yeah, well...

437
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:04,361
- Opposites attract, I s'pose.
- We're not...

438
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:07,921
You should get yourself a hobby.
Stamps, maybe. Model trains. Safer.

439
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:11,801
Before you ask, yes,
it's Monkford's blood. DNA checks out.

440
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,801
- No body.
- Not yet.

441
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:18,161
Get a sample sent
to the lab.

442
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:26,001
- Mrs Monkford...
- Yes.

443
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:28,601
Sorry, but I've already spoken
with two policemen.

444
00:30:28,681 --> 00:30:31,841
- We're not from the police, we're...
- Sherlock Holmes.

445
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:33,881
Very old friend
of your husband's.

446
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:35,401
We, um...

447
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,961
We grew up together.

448
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:40,241
I'm sorry. Who?

449
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:44,761
- I don't think he ever mentioned you.
- Oh, he must have done. This is...

450
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:47,321
This is horrible.
I mean, I just can't believe it.

451
00:30:47,401 --> 00:30:52,001
I only saw him the other day.
Same old Ian. Not a care in the world.

452
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:56,401
Sorry... My husband has been
depressed for months.

453
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:58,601
Who are you?

454
00:30:58,681 --> 00:31:01,921
Really strange
that he hired a car.

455
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:04,521
Why would he do that?
It's a bit suspicious, isn't it?

456
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:07,801
No, it isn't. He forgot to renew
the tax on the car, that's all.

457
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:11,841
Ah, well! That was Ian.
That was Ian all over.

458
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:15,681
- No, it wasn't.
- Wasn't it? Interesting.

459
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:19,321
- Who was I talking to?
- Why did you lie to her?

460
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:22,881
People don't like telling you things.
They love to contradict you.

461
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:25,281
- Past tense, did you notice?
- Sorry, what?

462
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:28,601
I referred to her husband in the past
tense. She joined in. Bit premature.

463
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:31,641
- They've only just found the car.
- You think she murdered her husband.

464
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:33,721
Definitely not. That's not a mistake
a murderer would make.

465
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:37,001
- I see... No, I don't. What am I seeing?
- Fishing.

466
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:39,321
Try fishing.

467
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:41,761
- Where now?
- Janus Cars.

468
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:44,561
Just found this
in the glove compartment.

469
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:55,601
Can't see how
I can help you gentlemen.

470
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:58,161
Mr Monkford hired the car
from you yesterday.

471
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:02,321
Yeah, lovely motor. Mazda RX8.
Wouldn't mind one of them myself.

472
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:04,161
Is that one?

473
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:08,841
No, they're all Jags.
I can see you're not a car man, eh!

474
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:11,721
But surely you can afford one -
a Mazda, I mean.

475
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:15,121
Yeah, that's a fair point. You know how
it is. It's like working in a sweet shop.

476
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:18,201
Once you start picking up the Liquorice
Allsorts, when does it all stop, eh?

477
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:21,041
- You didn't know Mr Monkford.
- No, he was just a client.

478
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:23,281
He came in here
and hired one of my cars.

479
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:25,401
I've no idea what happened to him.
Poor sod!

480
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:27,641
- Nice holiday, Mr Ewart?
- Eh?

481
00:32:27,721 --> 00:32:31,961
- You've been away, haven't you?
- Oh, the... No, it's sunbeds, I'm afraid.

482
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:35,641
Too busy to get away.
My wife would love it, though - bit of sun.

483
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,681
Have you got any change
for the cigarette machine?

484
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:39,041
- What?
- I noticed one on the way in...

485
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:41,121
...and I haven't got any change.
I'm gasping.

486
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:42,041
Um... Oh!

487
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:47,801
No, sorry.

488
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:51,561
Oh, well! Thank you very much
for your time, Mr Ewart.

489
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:54,521
You've been very helpful.
Come on, John!

490
00:32:55,961 --> 00:33:00,881
- I've got change, if you still want to...
- Nicotine patches. Remember? I'm doing well.

491
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:04,361
- So, what was all that about?
- I needed to look inside his wallet.

492
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,881
- Why?
- Mr Ewart's a liar.

493
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:41,681
Hello.

494
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:46,081
The clue's in the name -
Janus Cars.

495
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:49,521
Why would you
be giving me a clue?

496
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:52,761
Why does anyone
do anything?

497
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:56,521
Because I'm bored.

498
00:33:57,321 --> 00:33:59,761
We were made
for each other, Sherlock.

499
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:02,561
Then talk to me
in your own voice.

500
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:04,601
Patience.

501
00:34:25,921 --> 00:34:28,081
How much blood was on that seat,
would you say?

502
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:29,801
How much?
About a pint.

503
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:33,001
Not about. Exactly a pint.
That was their first mistake.

504
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:35,921
The blood's definitely Ian Monkford's,
but it's been frozen.

505
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:38,601
- Frozen?
- There are clear signs.

506
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:41,401
I think Ian Monkford
gave a pint of his blood some time ago...

507
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:43,001
...and that's what
they spread on the seat.

508
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,441
- Who did?
- Janus Cars. The clue's in the name.

509
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:49,721
- The god with two faces?
- Exactly.

510
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:51,161
They provide
a very special service.

511
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:54,601
If you've got any kind of a problem -
money troubles, bad marriage, whatever -

512
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:57,321
Janus Cars
will help you disappear.

513
00:34:57,401 --> 00:34:59,401
Ian Monkford was up to his eyes
in some kind of trouble...

514
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:02,601
...financial at a guess, he's a banker -
couldn't see a way out.

515
00:35:02,681 --> 00:35:04,881
But if he were to vanish,
if the car he hired...

516
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:07,401
...was found abandoned with his blood
all over the driver's seat...

517
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,441
- So where is he?
- Colombia.

518
00:35:09,521 --> 00:35:10,841
Colombia?

519
00:35:10,921 --> 00:35:15,121
Mr Ewart, of Janus Cars, had a
20,000 Colombian peso note in his wallet.

520
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,841
Quite a bit of change, too.

521
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:20,201
He told us he hadn't been
abroad recently...

522
00:35:20,281 --> 00:35:23,881
...but when I asked him about the cars,
I could see his tan line clearly.

523
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:26,721
No-one wears a shirt on a sunbed.
That, plus his arm.

524
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:28,721
- His arm?
- He kept scratching it.

525
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:32,481
Obviously irritating him, and bleeding. Why?
Because he'd recently had a booster jab.

526
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:34,721
Hep-B, probably.
Difficult to tell at that distance.

527
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:38,761
Conclusion: He'd just come back from settling
Ian Monkford into his new life in Colombia.

528
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:42,881
Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance,
and she splits it with Janus Cars.

529
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:45,441
- Mrs Monkford?
- Oh, yes. She's in on it too.

530
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:47,961
Now, go and arrest them, Inspector,
that's what you do best.

531
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:52,001
We need to let our friendly bomber
know that the case is solved.

532
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:54,081
I am on fire!

533
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:15,881
He says...

534
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:17,681
...you can come
and fetch me.

535
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:21,201
Help!

536
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:22,841
Help me, please!

537
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:40,561
Feeling better?

538
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:44,601
To be honest, we've hardly stopped
for breath since this thing started.

539
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:47,481
- Has it occurred to you...?
- Probably.

540
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:51,281
No, has it occurred to you that
the bomber's playing a game with you?

541
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:55,561
The envelope, breaking into the other flat, the
dead kid's shoes - it's all meant for you.

542
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:56,881
Yes, I know.

543
00:36:57,921 --> 00:37:00,401
Is it him, then?
Moriarty?

544
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:01,841
Perhaps.

545
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:11,401
- That could be anybody.
- Well, it could be, yeah.

546
00:37:12,161 --> 00:37:14,321
Lucky for you, I've been
more than a little unemployed.

547
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,641
- How d'you mean?
- Lucky for you...

548
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:17,641
...Mrs Hudson and I
watch far too much telly.

549
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:28,961
...Thank you, Tyra!
Doesn't she look lovely, everybody, now?

550
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:31,601
Anyway...

551
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:33,641
Speaking of silk purses...

552
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:36,481
- Hello?
- This one...

553
00:37:37,161 --> 00:37:38,921
...is a bit...

554
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,441
...defective.

555
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:44,321
Sorry.

556
00:37:46,321 --> 00:37:48,401
She's blind.

557
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:51,521
This is...

558
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:55,441
...a funny one.

559
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,041
I'll give you...

560
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:06,001
...12 hours.

561
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:11,201
Why are you doing this?

562
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,521
I like...

563
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:17,681
...to watch you...

564
00:38:19,761 --> 00:38:21,321
...dance.

565
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:32,921
...and I see you're back
to your bad habits.

566
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:37,601
...continuing into the sudden death of the
popular TV personality Connie Prince.

567
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:41,241
Miss Prince, famous for her makeover
programmes, was found dead two days ago...

568
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,361
...by her brother in the house
they shared in Ham...

569
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:50,481
Connie Prince, 54, she had one
of those makeover shows on the telly.

570
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,841
- Did you see it?
- No.

571
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:56,001
- Very popular, she was going places.
- Not any more.

572
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:58,761
So, dead two days. According to one
of her staff, Raoul de Santos...

573
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:01,361
...she cut her hand on a rusty nail
in the garden.

574
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,601
Nasty wound. Tetanus bacteria
enters the bloodstream...

575
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:07,521
...good night, Vienna.

576
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:09,001
I s'pose.

577
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:12,281
- Something's wrong with this picture.
- Eh?

578
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:13,441
Can't be as simple
as it seems...

579
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:16,681
...otherwise the bomber
wouldn't be directing us towards it.

580
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:18,001
Something's wrong.

581
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:40,881
John?

582
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:45,801
Cut on her hand, it's deep.
Would have bled a lot, right?

583
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:48,801
- Yeah.
- But the wound's clean.

584
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:51,201
Very clean, and fresh.

585
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:57,481
How long would the bacteria
have been incubating inside her?

586
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,241
Eight, ten days.

587
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:03,401
The cut was made later.

588
00:40:04,281 --> 00:40:06,841
- After she was dead?
- Must have been.

589
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:11,961
The only question is, how did the tetanus
enter the dead woman's system?

590
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:13,921
- You want to help, right?
- Of course.

591
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:16,561
Connie Prince's background -
family history, everything, give me data.

592
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:17,961
Right.

593
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,841
There's something else
that we haven't thought of.

594
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:25,161
- Is there?
- Yes. Why is he doing this, the bomber?

595
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:27,961
If this woman's death was suspicious,
why point it up?

596
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:31,081
- Good Samaritan.
- Who press-gangs suicide bombers?

597
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:34,001
- Bad Samaritan.
- I'm... I'm serious, Sherlock.

598
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:36,561
Listen, I'm cutting you slack here,
I'm trusting you...

599
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:39,881
...but out there somewhere,
some poor bastard's covered in Semtex...

600
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:43,481
...and he's just waiting for you
to solve the puzzle, so just tell me:

601
00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:45,881
What are we dealing with?

602
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:48,521
Something new.

603
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:01,961
Connection, connection, connection.
There must be a connection.

604
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:04,401
Carl Powers,
killed 20 years ago.

605
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:06,521
The bomber knew him,
admitted that he knew him.

606
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:09,441
The bomber's iPhone was in the stationery
from the Czech Republic.

607
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:11,281
The first hostage from Cornwall,
the second from London...

608
00:41:11,361 --> 00:41:12,881
...the third from Yorkshire,
judging by her accent.

609
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:16,361
What's he doing? Working his way
round the world, showing off?

610
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:23,761
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

611
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:28,281
Joining the... dots.

612
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:32,441
Three hours.

613
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,161
Boom...

614
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,681
...boom.

615
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:55,001
We're devastated,
of course we are.

616
00:41:58,761 --> 00:42:01,721
- Can I get you anything, sir?
- Er, no. No, thanks.

617
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:08,201
Raoul is my rock.
I don't think I could have managed.

618
00:42:09,721 --> 00:42:12,521
We didn't always see
eye to eye...

619
00:42:13,721 --> 00:42:15,641
...but my sister
was very dear to me.

620
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:19,241
And to the, er, public,
Mr Prince.

621
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:21,121
Oh, she was adored.

622
00:42:22,321 --> 00:42:26,081
I've seen her take girls who looked like
the back end of Routemasters and...

623
00:42:26,161 --> 00:42:28,401
...turn them
into princesses.

624
00:42:29,161 --> 00:42:34,001
Still, it's a relief, in a way, to know
that she's beyond this veil of tears.

625
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:36,481
Absolutely.

626
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:38,481
Great.

627
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:42,801
- Thank you. Thanks again.
- It's a real shame. I liked her.

628
00:42:42,881 --> 00:42:46,121
- She taught you how to do your colours.
- Colours?

629
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:51,601
You know, what goes best with what.
I should never wear cerise, apparently.

630
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:53,081
Drains me.

631
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:55,081
- Who's that?
- Home Office.

632
00:42:55,161 --> 00:42:57,201
- Home Office?
- Well, Home Secretary, actually.

633
00:42:57,281 --> 00:42:58,361
Owes me a favour.

634
00:42:58,441 --> 00:43:01,441
She was a pretty girl, but she
messed about with herself too much.

635
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:05,321
They all do these days.
People can hardly move their faces.

636
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:06,961
It's silly, isn't it?

637
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:12,041
- Did you ever see her show?
- Not until now.

638
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:20,521
- You look pasty, love.
- Ah, rained every day but one...

639
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:24,161
That's the brother. No love lost there,
if you can believe the papers.

640
00:43:24,241 --> 00:43:25,041
So I gather.

641
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:28,041
I've just been having a very fruitful chat
with people who love this show.

642
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:32,921
- The fan site's indispensable for gossip.
- ...with that ensemble, don't you think, girls?

643
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:38,001
Off, off, off, off,
off, off, off!

644
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:40,801
Yeah, it's more common
than people think.

645
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:42,441
The tetanus is in the soil...

646
00:43:42,521 --> 00:43:46,401
...people cut themselves on rose bushes
garden forks, that sort of thing.

647
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:48,801
If left un... treated...

648
00:43:48,881 --> 00:43:52,041
- I don't know what I'm going to do now.
- Right.

649
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:55,681
I mean,
she's left me this place...

650
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:57,321
...which is lovely.

651
00:43:59,401 --> 00:44:03,041
- But it's not the same without her.
- That's why...

652
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:08,401
...my paper wanted to get the, erm... the
full story straight from the horse's mouth.

653
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:10,041
- Are you sure it's not too soon?
- No.

654
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:11,441
Right.

655
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:13,961
You fire away.

656
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:24,761
John.

657
00:44:24,841 --> 00:44:27,441
Hi. Look, get over here quickly.
I think I'm onto something.

658
00:44:27,521 --> 00:44:30,161
You'll need to pick up some stuff first.
Have you got a pen?

659
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:31,401
I'll remember.

660
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,481
- That'll be him.
- What?

661
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:37,721
- Ah, Mr Prince, isn't it?
- Yes.

662
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,681
- Very good to meet you.
- Yes, thank you.

663
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,761
- So sorry to hear about...
- Yes, yes, very kind.

664
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:44,481
Shall we, er...?

665
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:47,961
You were right,
the bacteria got into her another way.

666
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,801
- Oh, yes?
- Yes.

667
00:44:49,881 --> 00:44:53,561
- Right, are we all set?
- Er, yes. Shall we...?

668
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:58,121
Er, not too close.
I'm raw from crying.

669
00:44:58,201 --> 00:45:00,521
- Oh, who's this?
- Sekhmet.

670
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:03,001
- Named after the Egyptian goddess.
- How nice.

671
00:45:03,081 --> 00:45:06,681
- Was she Connie's?
- Yes, a little present from yours truly.

672
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,801
Sherlock, light reading?

673
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:11,401
Oh, er...

674
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:15,321
- Bloody hell! What are you playing at?
- Sorry!

675
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:18,001
You're like Laurel and bloody
Hardy, you two! What's going on?

676
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:19,681
Actually, I think we've got
what we came for. Excuse us.

677
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:21,081
- What?
- Sherlock.

678
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:23,041
- What?
- We've got deadlines.

679
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:25,561
But you've not
taken anything!

680
00:45:29,241 --> 00:45:30,961
Yes! Ooh, yes!

681
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:34,041
You think it was the cat.
It wasn't the cat.

682
00:45:34,121 --> 00:45:38,201
What? Yes. Yeah, it is. It must be. It's
how he got the tetanus into her system.

683
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:40,921
- Its paws stink of disinfectant.
- Lovely idea.

684
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:43,561
No, he coated it
onto the claws of her cat.

685
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:46,321
It's a new pet,
bound to be a bit jumpy around her.

686
00:45:46,401 --> 00:45:48,641
A scratch is almost inevitable.
She wouldn't...

687
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:50,641
I thought of it the minute
I saw the scratches on her arm...

688
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:53,801
...but it's too random
and too clever for the brother.

689
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:56,801
- He murdered his sister for her money.
- Did he?

690
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:59,281
- Didn't he?
- Nope. It was revenge.

691
00:45:59,361 --> 00:46:01,521
- Rev...? Who wanted revenge?
- Raoul, the houseboy.

692
00:46:01,601 --> 00:46:04,201
Kenny Prince was the butt
of his sister's jokes week in, week out.

693
00:46:04,281 --> 00:46:07,241
Virtual bullying campaign. Finally,
he had enough, fell out with her badly.

694
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:09,521
It's all on the website.

695
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:12,161
She threatened to disinherit Kenny,
Raoul had grown accustomed...

696
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:14,881
- ...to a certain lifestyle...
- Wait. Wait! Wait a second.

697
00:46:14,961 --> 00:46:17,241
What about the disinfectant, then,
on the cat's claws?

698
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:19,641
Raoul keeps a very clean house.
You came through the kitchen door...

699
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:22,481
...saw the state of that floor -
scrubbed within an inch of its life.

700
00:46:22,561 --> 00:46:25,681
You smell of disinfectant.
I know the cat doesn't come into it.

701
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:29,561
Raoul's internet records do, though.
I hope we can get a cab from here.

702
00:46:38,481 --> 00:46:40,481
Raoul de Santos
is your killer.

703
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:42,521
Kenny Prince's houseboy.

704
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:46,001
Second autopsy shows it wasn't tetanus
that poisoned Connie Prince...

705
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:47,961
...it was botulinum toxin.

706
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:52,281
We've been here before. Carl Powers.
Tut-tut. Our bomber's repeated himself.

707
00:46:52,361 --> 00:46:54,321
- So how'd he do it?
- Botox injection.

708
00:46:54,401 --> 00:46:57,241
- Botox?
- Botox is a diluted form of botulinum.

709
00:46:57,321 --> 00:46:59,401
Among other things,
Raoul de Santos was employed...

710
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:01,721
...to give Connie
her regular facial injections.

711
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:03,241
My contact at
the Home Office gave me...

712
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,201
...the complete records
of Raoul's internet purchases.

713
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:07,561
He's been bulk ordering
Botox for months.

714
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:10,321
Bided his time, then upped the strength
to a fatal dose.

715
00:47:10,401 --> 00:47:12,201
- Are you sure about this?
- I'm sure.

716
00:47:12,281 --> 00:47:14,001
All right, my office.

717
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,561
- Hey, Sherlock, how long?
- What?

718
00:47:15,641 --> 00:47:17,841
- How long have you known?
- Well, this one was quite simple.

719
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:20,001
And like I said, the bomber repeated
himself. That was a mistake.

720
00:47:20,081 --> 00:47:23,401
No, but, Sherlock, the hostage, the old
woman, she's been there all this time!

721
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:26,881
I knew I could save her. I also knew
that the bomber had given us 12 hours.

722
00:47:26,961 --> 00:47:30,641
I solved the case quickly, that gave me time
to get on with other things. Don't you see?

723
00:47:30,721 --> 00:47:32,721
We're one up on him.

724
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:52,721
Hello.

725
00:47:53,841 --> 00:47:55,961
Help me!

726
00:47:56,561 --> 00:47:58,681
Tell us where you are.

727
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:01,281
- Address?
- He was so...

728
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:03,481
His voice...

729
00:48:03,561 --> 00:48:05,641
No, no, no, no!
Tell me nothing about him, nothing.

730
00:48:05,721 --> 00:48:08,201
He sounded so...

731
00:48:08,281 --> 00:48:09,641
...soft.

732
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:13,721
Hello?

733
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,361
Sherlock?

734
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:18,721
What's happened?

735
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:34,601
The explosion, which ripped through
several floors, killing 12 people...

736
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:38,161
- Old block of flats.
- ...caused by a faulty gas main.

737
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:41,601
- A spokesman from the utility company...
- He certainly gets about.

738
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:44,601
- ...with the emergency services.
- Well, obviously I lost that round.

739
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:48,121
Although technically,
I did solve the case.

740
00:48:50,881 --> 00:48:53,801
He killed the old lady
because she started to describe him.

741
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:57,241
Just once,
he put himself in the firing line.

742
00:48:57,321 --> 00:49:01,601
- What d'you mean?
- Well, usually, he... must stay above it all.

743
00:49:01,681 --> 00:49:05,601
He organises these things,
but no-one ever has direct contact.

744
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:11,041
What, like the Connie Prince murder,
he arranged that?

745
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:15,041
So, people come to him wanting their
crimes fixed up, like booking a holiday?

746
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:16,161
Novel.

747
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:20,761
Huh!

748
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:34,041
Taking his time this time.

749
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:41,521
- Anything on the Carl Powers case?
- Nothing.

750
00:49:42,281 --> 00:49:45,521
All the living classmates check out
spotless, no connection.

751
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:48,841
- Maybe the killer was older than Carl?
- The thought had occurred.

752
00:49:48,921 --> 00:49:51,161
So why is he doing this, then?
Playing this game with you.

753
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:52,921
Do you think
he wants to be caught?

754
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,081
I think he wants
to be distracted.

755
00:49:57,681 --> 00:50:00,121
I hope you'll be
very happy together.

756
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,801
- Sorry, what?
- There are lives at stake, Sherlock.

757
00:50:04,881 --> 00:50:08,521
Actual human lives! Just so I know,
do you care about that at all?

758
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:10,721
- Will caring about them help save them?
- Nope.

759
00:50:10,801 --> 00:50:12,481
Then I'll continue not
to make that mistake.

760
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:15,241
- And you find that easy, do you?
- Yes, very.

761
00:50:15,321 --> 00:50:18,121
- Is that news to you?
- No, no.

762
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:24,681
- I've disappointed you.
- That's good, that's a good deduction, yeah.

763
00:50:24,761 --> 00:50:26,441
Don't make people
into heroes, John.

764
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:29,961
Heroes don't exist, and if they did,
I wouldn't be one of them.

765
00:50:31,841 --> 00:50:33,201
Excellent.

766
00:50:34,801 --> 00:50:36,201
A view of the Thames.

767
00:50:36,281 --> 00:50:39,841
South Bank, somewhere between
Southwark Bridge and Waterloo.

768
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,961
You check the papers,
I'll look online.

769
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:47,281
Oh, you're angry with me,
so you won't help.

770
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:50,201
Not much cop,
this caring lark.

771
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:12,441
- Archway suicide...
- Ten-a-penny.

772
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:18,641
Two kids stabbed
in Stoke Newington.

773
00:51:18,721 --> 00:51:20,081
Ah...

774
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:22,881
...man found on the train line,
Andrew West.

775
00:51:22,961 --> 00:51:24,281
Nothing!

776
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:29,721
It's me. Have you found anything on
the South Bank between Waterloo Bridge...

777
00:51:29,801 --> 00:51:31,721
...and Southwark Bridge?

778
00:51:52,521 --> 00:51:54,641
Do you reckon this is connected,
then, the bomber?

779
00:51:54,721 --> 00:51:57,161
Must be. Odd, though,
he hasn't been in touch.

780
00:51:57,241 --> 00:52:00,441
Then we must assume that some
poor bugger's primed to explode, yeah?

781
00:52:00,521 --> 00:52:01,921
Yes.

782
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:03,401
Any ideas?

783
00:52:03,481 --> 00:52:05,281
Seven, so far.

784
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:06,641
Seven?

785
00:52:36,881 --> 00:52:39,321
He's dead about 24 hours.

786
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:43,121
Maybe a bit longer.
Did he drown?

787
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,321
Apparently not. Not enough of the Thames
in his lungs, asphyxiated.

788
00:52:46,401 --> 00:52:48,041
Yes, I'd agree.

789
00:52:48,121 --> 00:52:52,521
There's quite a bit of bruising
around the nose and mouth.

790
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,921
More bruises...

791
00:52:56,321 --> 00:52:58,241
...here and here.

792
00:53:02,281 --> 00:53:03,841
Fingertips.

793
00:53:05,281 --> 00:53:08,561
He's late 30s, I'd say,
not in the best condition.

794
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:13,241
He's been in the river a long while,
the water's destroyed most of the data.

795
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:17,681
But I'll tell you one thing,
that lost Vermeer painting's a fake.

796
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:18,601
What?

797
00:53:18,681 --> 00:53:20,601
We need to identify the corpse,
find out about his friends...

798
00:53:20,681 --> 00:53:23,801
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What painting? What are you on about?

799
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:25,721
It's all over the place,
haven't you seen the posters?

800
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:28,441
Dutch old master, supposed to
have been destroyed centuries ago.

801
00:53:28,521 --> 00:53:31,201
Now it's turned up,
worth £30 million.

802
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:33,921
OK, so what has that
got to do with the stiff?

803
00:53:34,241 --> 00:53:35,521
Everything.

804
00:53:35,601 --> 00:53:38,321
- Have you ever heard of the Golem?
- Golem?

805
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:40,681
It's a horror story, isn't it?
What are you saying?

806
00:53:40,761 --> 00:53:44,681
Jewish folk story, a gigantic man made
of clay, it's also the name of an assassin.

807
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:47,681
Real name - Oskar Dzundza. One of the
deadliest assassins in the world.

808
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:49,801
That is his trademark style.

809
00:53:49,881 --> 00:53:51,801
- So this is a hit?
- Definitely.

810
00:53:51,881 --> 00:53:54,881
The Golem squeezes the life
out of his victims with his bare hands.

811
00:53:54,961 --> 00:53:57,481
But what has this got to do
with that painting? I don't see...

812
00:53:57,561 --> 00:54:01,281
- You do see, you just don't observe!
- Yes, all right, all right, girls! Calm down.

813
00:54:02,841 --> 00:54:05,561
Sherlock, do you want
to take us through it?

814
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:10,641
What do we know
about this corpse?

815
00:54:10,721 --> 00:54:14,681
The killer's not left us with much,
just the shirt and the trousers.

816
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:16,761
They're pretty formal,
maybe he was going out for the night.

817
00:54:16,841 --> 00:54:20,441
The trousers are heavy duty.
Polyester, nasty, same as the shirt, cheap.

818
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:23,521
They're both too big for him.
So some kind of standard-issue uniform.

819
00:54:23,601 --> 00:54:25,441
Dressed for work, then.
What kind of work?

820
00:54:25,521 --> 00:54:28,241
There's a hook on his belt...
for a walkie-talkie.

821
00:54:28,321 --> 00:54:29,361
Tube driver?

822
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:31,441
- Security guard?
- More likely.

823
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:33,721
- That'll be borne out by his backside.
- Backside?

824
00:54:33,801 --> 00:54:36,001
Flabby, you'd think
he led a sedentary life.

825
00:54:36,081 --> 00:54:40,601
Yet the soles of his feet and the nascent
varicose veins in his legs show otherwise.

826
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:43,961
So, a lot of walking
and a lot of sitting around.

827
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:46,721
Security guard's looking good.
The watch helps too.

828
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:48,481
The alarm shows
he did regular night shifts.

829
00:54:48,561 --> 00:54:51,521
Why regular? Maybe he set his alarm
like that the night before he died?

830
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:54,361
No, no, no. The buttons
are stiff, hardly touched.

831
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:56,961
He set his alarm like that a long time ago,
his routine never varied.

832
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:58,881
But there's something else.
The killer must have been interrupted...

833
00:54:58,961 --> 00:55:00,641
...otherwise he would have stripped
the corpse completely.

834
00:55:00,721 --> 00:55:02,681
There was some kind of badge
or insignia on the shirt front...

835
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:06,081
...that he tore off, suggesting the
dead man works somewhere recognisable.

836
00:55:06,161 --> 00:55:07,801
Some kind of institution.

837
00:55:07,881 --> 00:55:11,441
I found this inside
his trouser pockets.

838
00:55:12,361 --> 00:55:14,921
Sodden by the river,
but still recognisably...

839
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:16,241
- Tickets?
- Ticket stubs.

840
00:55:16,321 --> 00:55:18,361
He worked in a museum or gallery.
Did a quick check.

841
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:21,201
The Hickman Gallery has reported
one of its attendants as missing:

842
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:22,961
Alex Woodbridge.

843
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:25,321
Tonight, they unveil
the rediscovered masterpiece.

844
00:55:25,401 --> 00:55:27,801
Now, why would anyone
want to pay the Golem...

845
00:55:27,881 --> 00:55:30,921
...to suffocate a perfectly ordinary
gallery attendant?

846
00:55:31,001 --> 00:55:32,801
Inference, the dead man
knew something about it...

847
00:55:32,881 --> 00:55:35,881
...something that would stop the owner
getting paid £30 million.

848
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:38,001
The pictures are fake.

849
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:39,121
Fantastic.

850
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:40,921
- Meretricious.
- And a Happy New Year.

851
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:44,481
Poor sod.

852
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:48,321
I'd better get my feelers out
for this Golem character.

853
00:55:48,401 --> 00:55:50,881
Pointless, you'll never find him,
but I know a man who can.

854
00:55:50,961 --> 00:55:52,641
- Who?
- Me.

855
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:03,961
Why hasn't he phoned?
He's broken his pattern. Why?

856
00:56:05,121 --> 00:56:06,441
Waterloo Bridge.

857
00:56:06,521 --> 00:56:09,561
- Where now, the gallery?
- In a bit.

858
00:56:10,001 --> 00:56:11,961
The Hickman's contemporary art,
isn't it?

859
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:14,601
- Why have they got hold of an old master?
- Don't know.

860
00:56:14,681 --> 00:56:17,281
Dangerous to jump
to conclusions.

861
00:56:17,761 --> 00:56:19,121
Need data...

862
00:56:36,321 --> 00:56:37,361
Stop!

863
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,321
Can you wait here?

864
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:41,121
I won't be a moment.

865
00:56:41,641 --> 00:56:42,961
Sherlock?

866
00:56:50,521 --> 00:56:52,321
Change? Any change?

867
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:56,161
- What for?
- Cup of tea, of course.

868
00:56:56,241 --> 00:56:58,041
Here you go,
a 50.

869
00:56:58,921 --> 00:57:00,361
Thanks.

870
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:05,041
- What are you doing?
- Investing.

871
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:15,521
Now we go
to the gallery.

872
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:17,481
Have you got any cash?

873
00:57:31,761 --> 00:57:35,161
No, I need you to find out all you can
about the gallery attendant.

874
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:38,761
- Lestrade will give you the address.
- OK.

875
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:53,801
We'd been sharing
about a year.

876
00:57:53,881 --> 00:57:55,521
Just sharing.

877
00:58:07,201 --> 00:58:08,841
- May I?
- Yeah.

878
00:58:11,281 --> 00:58:12,601
Sorry.

879
00:58:13,321 --> 00:58:17,281
- Stargazer, was he?
- God, yeah. Mad about it.

880
00:58:17,801 --> 00:58:20,401
It's all he ever did
in his spare time.

881
00:58:20,481 --> 00:58:22,681
He was a nice guy,
Alex.

882
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:24,521
I liked him.

883
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:27,481
He was, er...

884
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:30,961
...never much of a one
for hoovering.

885
00:58:33,241 --> 00:58:35,681
What about art?
Did he know anything about that?

886
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:38,241
It was just a job,
you know?

887
00:58:42,081 --> 00:58:45,521
Has anyone else been round
asking about Alex?

888
00:58:45,601 --> 00:58:46,721
No.

889
00:58:47,401 --> 00:58:49,121
- We had a break-in, though.
- When?

890
00:58:49,841 --> 00:58:53,081
Last night.
There was nothing taken.

891
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:58,001
Oh, there was a message
left for Alex on the land line.

892
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:00,641
- Who was it from?
- I can play it for you, if you like.

893
00:59:00,721 --> 00:59:02,561
- I'll get the phone...
- Please.

894
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:13,001
Oh, should I speak now? Alex?
Love, it's Professor Cairns.

895
00:59:13,081 --> 00:59:16,121
Listen, you were right.
You were bloody right.

896
00:59:16,201 --> 00:59:18,201
Give us a call when...

897
00:59:18,481 --> 00:59:21,201
- Professor Cairns?
- No idea, sorry.

898
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:25,121
Can I try and ring back?

899
00:59:25,721 --> 00:59:30,201
No good. I've had other calls since.
Sympathy ones, you know.

900
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:56,201
Don't you have
something to do?

901
00:59:56,281 --> 00:59:58,041
Just admiring the view.

902
00:59:58,441 --> 00:59:59,761
Yes.

903
00:59:59,841 --> 01:00:02,361
Lovely. Now go back to work -
we open tonight.

904
01:00:03,841 --> 01:00:05,921
- Doesn't it bother you?
- What?

905
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:08,401
That the painting's a fake.

906
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:09,081
What?

907
01:00:09,161 --> 01:00:11,761
It's a fake. It has to be.
It's the only possible explanation.

908
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,561
You are in charge,
aren't you, Miss Wenceslas?

909
01:00:14,641 --> 01:00:15,441
Who are you?

910
01:00:15,521 --> 01:00:17,161
Alex Woodbridge knew
that the painting was a fake...

911
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:19,441
...so somebody sent the Golem
to take care of him. Was it you?

912
01:00:19,521 --> 01:00:22,921
- Golem? What the hell are you talking about?
- Are you working for someone else?

913
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:25,841
- Did you fake it for them?
- It's not a fake.

914
01:00:25,921 --> 01:00:27,401
It is a fake.

915
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:30,041
I don't know why. But there's something
wrong with it, there has to be.

916
01:00:30,121 --> 01:00:32,841
What the hell are you on about?
I could have you sacked on the spot.

917
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,481
- Not a problem.
- No?

918
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:35,841
No, I don't work here,
you see.

919
01:00:35,921 --> 01:00:38,801
Just popped in to give you
a bit of friendly advice.

920
01:00:38,881 --> 01:00:39,961
How did you get in?

921
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:42,001
- Please!
- I want to know.

922
01:00:42,081 --> 01:00:45,441
The art of disguise is knowing
how to hide in plain sight.

923
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,361
- Who are you?
- Sherlock Holmes.

924
01:00:47,921 --> 01:00:51,641
- Am I supposed to be impressed?
- You should be.

925
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:53,961
Have a nice day.

926
01:01:09,521 --> 01:01:11,041
He wouldn't.

927
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:14,361
- He just wouldn't.
- No.

928
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:18,441
- Stranger things have happened.
- Westie wasn't a traitor.

929
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:22,921
It's a horrible thing to say! I'm sorry.
But you must understand that's...

930
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:25,121
That's what they think,
isn't it, his bosses?

931
01:01:25,201 --> 01:01:28,161
He was young man,
about to get married, he had debts.

932
01:01:28,801 --> 01:01:34,201
Everyone's got debts, and Westie wouldn't want
to clear them by selling out his country.

933
01:01:34,961 --> 01:01:39,561
Can you, erm...? Can you tell me
exactly what happened that night?

934
01:01:39,641 --> 01:01:42,081
We were having
a night in.

935
01:01:42,761 --> 01:01:45,441
Just... watching a DVD.

936
01:01:45,521 --> 01:01:49,121
He normally falls asleep, you know,
but he sat through this one.

937
01:01:51,161 --> 01:01:52,521
He was quiet.

938
01:01:54,321 --> 01:01:58,041
Out of the blue he said he just
had to go and see someone.

939
01:01:58,121 --> 01:01:59,481
And you've no idea who?

940
01:02:07,801 --> 01:02:09,881
Hi, Liz.
You OK, love?

941
01:02:09,961 --> 01:02:11,081
Yeah.

942
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:13,481
- Who's this?
- John Watson, hi.

943
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:15,681
This is my brother,
Joe.

944
01:02:15,761 --> 01:02:17,961
John's trying to find out
what happened to Westie, Joe.

945
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:20,241
- You with the police?
- Sort of, yeah.

946
01:02:20,321 --> 01:02:22,881
Tell them to get off their arses, will you?
It's bloody ridiculous.

947
01:02:22,961 --> 01:02:24,721
I'll do my best.

948
01:02:30,401 --> 01:02:31,881
Well, er...

949
01:02:31,961 --> 01:02:36,401
...thanks very much for your help.
Again, I'm very, very sorry.

950
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:39,321
He didn't steal those things,
Mr Watson.

951
01:02:40,641 --> 01:02:43,361
I knew Westie,
he was a good man.

952
01:02:44,001 --> 01:02:46,241
He was my good man.

953
01:03:09,401 --> 01:03:11,321
- Spare change?
- No.

954
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:13,641
Any spare change?

955
01:03:20,441 --> 01:03:22,841
Alex Woodbridge didn't know
anything special about art.

956
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:24,681
- And?
- And...

957
01:03:24,761 --> 01:03:27,721
- Is that it? No habits, hobbies, personality?
- Give us a chance.

958
01:03:27,801 --> 01:03:30,881
- He was an amateur astronomer.
- Hold that cab.

959
01:03:30,961 --> 01:03:32,641
- Spare change, sir?
- Don't mind if I do.

960
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:34,441
Can you wait here?

961
01:03:37,761 --> 01:03:40,001
Fortunately,
I haven't been idle.

962
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:42,281
Come on.

963
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,921
Beautiful, isn't it?

964
01:04:10,441 --> 01:04:14,481
- I thought you didn't care about...
- Doesn't mean I can't appreciate it.

965
01:04:14,561 --> 01:04:18,041
Listen, Alex Woodbridge had a message
on the answerphone at his flat.

966
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:21,161
- A Professor Cairns.
- This way.

967
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:22,281
Nice.

968
01:04:23,001 --> 01:04:24,801
Nice part of town.

969
01:04:27,561 --> 01:04:30,801
- Any time you want to explain?
- Homeless network.

970
01:04:30,881 --> 01:04:34,001
- Really is indispensable.
- Homeless network?

971
01:04:34,081 --> 01:04:37,241
- My eyes and ears, all over the city.
- Ah, that's... clever.

972
01:04:37,321 --> 01:04:40,281
- So you scratch their backs, and...?
- Yes, then disinfect myself.

973
01:05:00,721 --> 01:05:02,041
Sherlock! Come on!

974
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:08,241
- What's he doing sleeping rough?
- Well, he has a very distinctive look.

975
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:11,281
He has to hide somewhere
where tongues won't wag... much.

976
01:05:11,361 --> 01:05:12,881
- Oh...
- What?

977
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:15,761
- I wish I...
- Don't mention it.

978
01:05:23,761 --> 01:05:25,921
No! No! No! No!

979
01:05:26,601 --> 01:05:29,401
It'll take us weeks
to find him again.

980
01:05:30,121 --> 01:05:32,161
Or not. I have an idea
where he might be going.

981
01:05:32,241 --> 01:05:33,761
- What?
- I told you...

982
01:05:33,841 --> 01:05:35,521
...someone left
Alex Woodbridge a message.

983
01:05:35,601 --> 01:05:39,041
There can't be that many
Professor Cairns in the book. Come on.

984
01:05:45,561 --> 01:05:49,921
Jupiter, the fifth planet
in our solar system, and the largest.

985
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:55,321
Jupiter is a gas giant.
Planet Earth would fit into it 11 times.

986
01:05:55,401 --> 01:05:57,441
Yes, we know that.

987
01:06:01,361 --> 01:06:05,321
- Titan is the largest moon...
- Come on, Neptune.

988
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:12,761
Many are actually
long dead...

989
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:16,401
- Tom, is that you?
- ...exploded into supernovas.

990
01:06:17,721 --> 01:06:21,321
Discovered by
Urbain Le Verrier in 1846...

991
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:27,121
...composed mainly
of hydrogen.

992
01:06:27,801 --> 01:06:31,321
- Their light takes so long to reach us...
- Golem!

993
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:34,961
...many are actually long dead,
exploded into...

994
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:40,641
- John!
- I can't see him. I'll go round.

995
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:45,161
Who are you working for,
Dzundza?

996
01:06:48,121 --> 01:06:52,361
A star begins as a collapsing ball
of material composed mainly of...

997
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:53,081
Golem!

998
01:06:57,161 --> 01:06:58,721
Let him go...

999
01:06:59,681 --> 01:07:01,641
...or I will kill you.

1000
01:07:09,001 --> 01:07:15,481
The fourth planet of the solar system,
named after the Roman God of War.

1001
01:07:22,641 --> 01:07:24,681
...it is a gas giant...

1002
01:07:35,201 --> 01:07:37,521
...takes so long
to reach us...

1003
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:41,521
...into supernovas...

1004
01:07:46,121 --> 01:07:48,761
...exploded into supernovas...

1005
01:07:50,961 --> 01:07:52,721
It's a fake.
It has to be.

1006
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:55,561
That painting has been subjected
to every test known to science.

1007
01:07:55,641 --> 01:07:58,241
It's a very good fake, then.
You know about this, don't you?

1008
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:01,521
- This is you, isn't it?
- Inspector, my time is being wasted.

1009
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:04,801
Would you mind showing yourself
and your friends out?

1010
01:08:06,441 --> 01:08:08,721
The painting is a fake.

1011
01:08:09,401 --> 01:08:13,161
It's a fake, that's why Woodbridge
and Cairns were killed.

1012
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:17,121
Oh, come on,
proving it's just a detail.

1013
01:08:17,201 --> 01:08:20,441
The painting is a fake.
I've solved it, I've figured it out.

1014
01:08:20,521 --> 01:08:23,801
It's a fake, that's the answer,
that's why they were killed.

1015
01:08:28,321 --> 01:08:32,121
OK, I'll prove it. Give me time.
Will you give me time?

1016
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:33,681
10...

1017
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:37,321
- It's a kid. Oh God, it's a kid.
- What did he say?

1018
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:38,441
- 10.
- 9.

1019
01:08:38,521 --> 01:08:40,241
He's giving me time.

1020
01:08:40,321 --> 01:08:42,321
- Jesus...
- It's a fake, but how can I prove it?

1021
01:08:42,401 --> 01:08:44,001
- How? How?
- 8.

1022
01:08:44,081 --> 01:08:46,801
This kid will die. Tell me
why the painting is a fake. Tell me!

1023
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:47,921
- 7.
- No, shut up.

1024
01:08:48,001 --> 01:08:50,361
Don't say anything.
It only works if I figure it out.

1025
01:08:52,201 --> 01:08:54,761
It must be possible.
It must be staring me in the face.

1026
01:08:54,841 --> 01:08:56,281
- 6.
- How?

1027
01:08:57,401 --> 01:08:58,961
Woodbridge knew,
but how?

1028
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:01,441
- 5.
- It's speeding up! Sherlock!

1029
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:04,601
- 4.
- In the Planetarium, you heard it too.

1030
01:09:04,681 --> 01:09:06,641
Oh, that is brilliant,
that is gorgeous!

1031
01:09:06,721 --> 01:09:08,881
- 3.
- What's brilliant? What is?

1032
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:11,201
This is beautiful.
Marvellous.

1033
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:12,841
- 2.
- Sherlock!

1034
01:09:13,241 --> 01:09:15,601
The Van Buren Supernova.

1035
01:09:16,801 --> 01:09:20,441
Please, is somebody there?
Somebody help me.

1036
01:09:20,921 --> 01:09:24,561
There you go. Go and find out
where he is and pick him up.

1037
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:28,681
Van Buren Supernova,
so-called.

1038
01:09:29,281 --> 01:09:33,721
Exploding star.
Only appeared in the sky in 1858.

1039
01:09:34,681 --> 01:09:36,961
So how could it
have been...

1040
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:40,121
...painted in the 1640s?

1041
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:48,241
Oh, Sherl...

1042
01:09:51,481 --> 01:09:53,041
You know,
it's interesting.

1043
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:59,521
Bohemian stationery, an assassin named after
a Prague legend, and you, Miss Wenceslas.

1044
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:02,081
This whole case has a distinctly
Czech feeling about it.

1045
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:04,401
Is that where this leads?

1046
01:10:05,881 --> 01:10:08,441
What are we looking at,
Inspector?

1047
01:10:08,961 --> 01:10:14,121
Well, criminal conspiracy, fraud, accessory
after the fact, at the very least.

1048
01:10:14,201 --> 01:10:16,441
The murder of the old woman,
all the people in the flat...

1049
01:10:16,521 --> 01:10:19,201
I didn't know anything
about that.

1050
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:22,121
All those things,
please, believe me.

1051
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:26,321
I just wanted my share.

1052
01:10:27,161 --> 01:10:28,761
The 30 million.

1053
01:10:36,841 --> 01:10:40,001
I found a little old man
in Argentina.

1054
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:47,241
A genius - I mean... really.
Brushwork, immaculate. Could fool anyone.

1055
01:10:49,641 --> 01:10:51,561
Well, nearly anyone.

1056
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:58,561
But I didn't know how to go about convincing
the world the picture was genuine.

1057
01:11:00,121 --> 01:11:02,121
It was just an idea.

1058
01:11:03,441 --> 01:11:07,081
- A spark which he blew into a flame.
- Who?

1059
01:11:07,881 --> 01:11:09,121
I don't know.

1060
01:11:09,201 --> 01:11:10,641
It's true!

1061
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:15,321
It took a long time,
but eventually I was...

1062
01:11:15,641 --> 01:11:17,961
...put in touch with people.

1063
01:11:19,881 --> 01:11:21,361
His people...

1064
01:11:23,161 --> 01:11:26,281
Well, there was never
any real contact.

1065
01:11:27,801 --> 01:11:30,001
Just messages...

1066
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:34,481
...whispers.

1067
01:11:35,481 --> 01:11:38,721
And did those whispers
have a name?

1068
01:11:48,321 --> 01:11:49,721
Moriarty.

1069
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:07,961
- So this is where West was found?
- Yeah.

1070
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:10,041
- Are you going to be long?
- I might be.

1071
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:11,601
- Are you the police, then?
- Sort of.

1072
01:12:11,681 --> 01:12:14,161
- I hate 'em.
- The police?

1073
01:12:14,241 --> 01:12:15,761
No, jumpers.

1074
01:12:15,841 --> 01:12:19,361
People who chuck 'emselves
in front of trains. Selfish bastards.

1075
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:24,321
- Well, that's one way of looking at it.
- I mean it. It's all right for them.

1076
01:12:24,401 --> 01:12:27,121
It's over in a split second,
strawberry jam all over the lines.

1077
01:12:27,201 --> 01:12:30,441
What about the drivers, eh?
They've got to live with it, haven't they?

1078
01:12:30,521 --> 01:12:34,561
Yeah, speaking of strawberry jam,
there's no blood on the line.

1079
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:38,241
- Has it been cleaned off?
- No, there wasn't that much.

1080
01:12:38,321 --> 01:12:42,801
- You said his head was smashed in.
- It was, but there wasn't much blood.

1081
01:12:44,001 --> 01:12:44,881
OK.

1082
01:12:47,481 --> 01:12:51,201
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.
Just give us a shout when you're off.

1083
01:12:51,281 --> 01:12:52,721
Right.

1084
01:12:53,561 --> 01:12:56,121
Right, so,
Andrew West...

1085
01:12:57,041 --> 01:13:00,561
...got on the train somewhere.
Or did he?

1086
01:13:01,121 --> 01:13:03,521
There was no ticket
on the body.

1087
01:13:04,841 --> 01:13:06,881
How did he end up here?

1088
01:13:13,801 --> 01:13:15,801
- The points.
- Yes!

1089
01:13:15,881 --> 01:13:17,801
I knew you'd
get there eventually.

1090
01:13:17,881 --> 01:13:20,481
West wasn't killed here,
that's why there was so little blood.

1091
01:13:20,561 --> 01:13:23,001
- How long have you been following me?
- Since the start.

1092
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:28,361
You don't think I'd give up on a case like
this just to spite my brother, do you?

1093
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:31,921
Come on, we've got
a bit of burglary to do.

1094
01:13:35,201 --> 01:13:36,961
Missile defence plans
haven't left the country...

1095
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:40,121
...otherwise Mycroft's people
would have heard about it.

1096
01:13:40,201 --> 01:13:43,201
Despite what people think,
we do still have a secret service.

1097
01:13:43,281 --> 01:13:45,441
Yeah, I know,
I've met them.

1098
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:48,121
Which means whoever stole
the memory stick can't sell it...

1099
01:13:48,201 --> 01:13:51,841
...or doesn't know what to do with it.
My money's on the latter.

1100
01:13:52,241 --> 01:13:54,481
- We're here.
- Where?

1101
01:14:03,761 --> 01:14:05,161
Sherlock!

1102
01:14:05,801 --> 01:14:07,841
What if there's someone in?

1103
01:14:08,521 --> 01:14:10,081
There isn't.

1104
01:14:13,201 --> 01:14:14,561
Jesus...

1105
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:17,881
- Where are we?
- Oh, sorry, didn't I say?

1106
01:14:17,961 --> 01:14:20,681
- Joe Harrison's flat.
- Joe...?

1107
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:25,321
Brother of West's fiancée.

1108
01:14:25,401 --> 01:14:29,601
He stole the memory stick,
killed his prospective brother-in-law.

1109
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:45,001
Then why did he do it?

1110
01:14:46,841 --> 01:14:48,521
Let's ask him.

1111
01:14:58,121 --> 01:14:59,841
Don't! Don't.

1112
01:15:05,521 --> 01:15:07,441
He wasn't meant to...

1113
01:15:10,521 --> 01:15:12,681
What's Lucy gonna say?

1114
01:15:12,761 --> 01:15:13,881
Jesus.

1115
01:15:13,961 --> 01:15:17,601
- Why did you kill him?
- It was an accident. I swear it was.

1116
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:23,321
But stealing the plans for the missile
defence program wasn't an accident, was it?

1117
01:15:23,761 --> 01:15:26,121
I started dealing drugs.

1118
01:15:26,961 --> 01:15:29,361
I mean, the bike thing's
a great cover, right?

1119
01:15:30,001 --> 01:15:31,961
I don't know
how it started.

1120
01:15:32,521 --> 01:15:34,321
I just got out of my depth.

1121
01:15:35,361 --> 01:15:38,801
I owed people thousands.
Serious people.

1122
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:44,121
Then at Westie's engagement do,
he starts talking about his job.

1123
01:15:45,721 --> 01:15:48,481
I mean, usually,
he's so careful.

1124
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:52,441
But that night, after a few pints,
he really opened up.

1125
01:15:53,121 --> 01:15:55,761
He told me
about these missile plans.

1126
01:15:56,361 --> 01:15:58,321
Beyond top secret.

1127
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:01,921
He showed me the memory stick,
he waved it in front of me.

1128
01:16:02,001 --> 01:16:07,041
You hear about these things getting lost...
ending up on rubbish tips and whatnot.

1129
01:16:07,921 --> 01:16:10,361
But there it was.
And I thought...

1130
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:13,241
Well, I thought
it could be worth a fortune.

1131
01:16:13,321 --> 01:16:17,161
It was pretty easy to get the thing
off him, he was so plastered.

1132
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,321
Next time I saw him...

1133
01:16:22,241 --> 01:16:24,481
...I could tell by the look on his face
that he knew.

1134
01:16:24,561 --> 01:16:27,281
- What are you doing here?
- What have you done with the plans?

1135
01:16:28,641 --> 01:16:29,961
What happened?

1136
01:16:36,201 --> 01:16:39,601
I was going to call an ambulance,
but it was too late.

1137
01:16:40,201 --> 01:16:43,041
I just didn't have a clue
what to do.

1138
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:45,921
So I dragged him in 'ere.

1139
01:16:46,281 --> 01:16:49,161
I just sat in the dark,
thinking.

1140
01:16:49,921 --> 01:16:53,641
When a neat little idea
popped into your head.

1141
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:36,681
Carrying Andrew West
way away from here.

1142
01:17:37,081 --> 01:17:40,681
His body would have gone on for ages if the train
hadn't hit a stretch of track with curves.

1143
01:17:40,761 --> 01:17:42,921
- And points.
- Exactly.

1144
01:17:46,841 --> 01:17:49,281
Do you still have it, then -
the memory stick?

1145
01:17:50,841 --> 01:17:53,841
Fetch it for me,
if you wouldn't mind.

1146
01:18:03,361 --> 01:18:06,161
- Distraction over - the game continues.
- Maybe that's over, too.

1147
01:18:06,241 --> 01:18:09,441
- We've heard nothing from the bomber.
- Five pips, remember, John.

1148
01:18:09,521 --> 01:18:12,961
It's a countdown.
We've only had four.

1149
01:18:16,721 --> 01:18:20,841
No, no, no!
Course he's not the boy's father.

1150
01:18:20,921 --> 01:18:24,001
Look at the turn-ups
on his jeans!

1151
01:18:25,321 --> 01:18:27,361
I knew it was dangerous.

1152
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:30,201
Getting you into crap telly.

1153
01:18:30,281 --> 01:18:32,681
Not a patch
on Connie Prince.

1154
01:18:33,081 --> 01:18:34,761
Have you given Mycroft
the memory stick yet?

1155
01:18:34,841 --> 01:18:37,321
Yep...
He was over the moon.

1156
01:18:38,121 --> 01:18:41,401
Threatened me
with a knighthood... again.

1157
01:18:41,761 --> 01:18:43,881
You know,
I'm still waiting.

1158
01:18:45,001 --> 01:18:47,441
For you to admit that a little knowledge
of the solar system...

1159
01:18:47,521 --> 01:18:50,361
...and you'd have cleared up
the fake painting a lot quicker.

1160
01:18:50,441 --> 01:18:51,881
It didn't do you any good,
did it?

1161
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:54,761
No, but I'm not the world's
only consulting detective.

1162
01:18:54,841 --> 01:18:55,721
True.

1163
01:18:55,801 --> 01:18:58,481
I won't be in for tea.
I'm going to Sarah's.

1164
01:18:58,561 --> 01:19:01,081
There's still some of
that risotto left in the fridge.

1165
01:19:01,161 --> 01:19:03,081
- Milk, we need milk.
- I'll get some.

1166
01:19:03,161 --> 01:19:05,001
- Really?
- Really.

1167
01:19:06,801 --> 01:19:08,681
And some beans, then?

1168
01:20:22,721 --> 01:20:26,121
Bought you a little
getting-to-know-you present.

1169
01:20:27,241 --> 01:20:29,921
That's what it's all been for,
isn't it?

1170
01:20:31,521 --> 01:20:34,281
All your little puzzles,
making me dance.

1171
01:20:34,361 --> 01:20:37,801
All to distract me
from this.

1172
01:20:50,281 --> 01:20:51,641
Evening.

1173
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:58,841
This is a turn-up,
isn't it, Sherlock?

1174
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:00,601
John!

1175
01:21:00,681 --> 01:21:03,041
- What the hell...?
- Bet you never saw this coming.

1176
01:21:09,521 --> 01:21:10,881
What...

1177
01:21:11,481 --> 01:21:14,361
...would you like me
to make him say...

1178
01:21:15,161 --> 01:21:16,481
...next?

1179
01:21:17,921 --> 01:21:19,241
Gottle o' gear.

1180
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:23,201
- Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear.
- Stop it.

1181
01:21:23,281 --> 01:21:25,001
Nice touch, this.
The pool...

1182
01:21:26,441 --> 01:21:28,801
...where little Carl dies.

1183
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:30,441
I stopped him.

1184
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:35,321
I can stop
John Watson, too.

1185
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:38,601
- Stop his heart.
- Who are you?

1186
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:42,601
I gave you my number.

1187
01:21:44,561 --> 01:21:47,001
I thought you might call.

1188
01:22:00,161 --> 01:22:04,081
Is that a British Army Browning
L9A1 in your pocket...

1189
01:22:05,201 --> 01:22:08,481
...or are you
just pleased to see me?

1190
01:22:08,561 --> 01:22:09,961
Both.

1191
01:22:11,841 --> 01:22:13,441
Jim Moriarty.

1192
01:22:14,881 --> 01:22:15,601
Hi.

1193
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:18,961
Jim?

1194
01:22:19,881 --> 01:22:22,081
Jim from the hospital?

1195
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:27,121
Oh, did I really make
such a fleeting impression?

1196
01:22:27,201 --> 01:22:30,561
But then, I suppose,
that was rather the point.

1197
01:22:32,521 --> 01:22:36,121
Don't be silly.
Someone else is holding the rifle.

1198
01:22:36,921 --> 01:22:38,921
I don't like getting
my hands dirty.

1199
01:22:43,321 --> 01:22:47,521
I've given you a glimpse, Sherlock,
just a teensy glimpse...

1200
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:51,561
...of what I've got going on
out there in the big bad world.

1201
01:22:51,921 --> 01:22:54,921
I'm a specialist,
you see.

1202
01:22:55,601 --> 01:22:57,121
Like you.

1203
01:22:57,521 --> 01:22:59,001
Dear Jim...

1204
01:23:00,841 --> 01:23:03,681
...please will you
fix it for me...

1205
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:06,601
...to get rid of
my lover's nasty sister?

1206
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:11,081
Dear Jim, please will you fix it for me
to disappear to South America?

1207
01:23:11,161 --> 01:23:12,601
Just so.

1208
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:14,921
Consulting criminal.

1209
01:23:16,081 --> 01:23:18,281
- Brilliant.
- Isn't it?

1210
01:23:19,641 --> 01:23:21,921
No-one ever gets to me.

1211
01:23:24,161 --> 01:23:25,881
And no-one ever will.

1212
01:23:26,281 --> 01:23:28,521
- I did.
- You've come the closest.

1213
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:30,121
- Now you're in my way.
- Thank you.

1214
01:23:30,201 --> 01:23:31,761
- Didn't mean it as a compliment.
- Yes, you did.

1215
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:33,441
Yeah, OK, I did.

1216
01:23:33,881 --> 01:23:38,041
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.
Daddy's had enough now.

1217
01:23:38,121 --> 01:23:40,641
I've shown you
what I can do.

1218
01:23:40,721 --> 01:23:43,921
I cut loose all those people,
all those little problems...

1219
01:23:44,001 --> 01:23:47,601
...even 30 million quid,
just to get you to come out and play.

1220
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:50,761
So take this
as a friendly warning...

1221
01:23:51,121 --> 01:23:52,601
...my dear.

1222
01:23:53,761 --> 01:23:55,241
Back off.

1223
01:23:56,321 --> 01:23:59,321
Although I have loved this...

1224
01:24:00,121 --> 01:24:05,081
...this little game of ours.
Playing Jim from IT.

1225
01:24:05,161 --> 01:24:07,961
Playing gay. Did you like
the little touch with the underwear?

1226
01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:10,881
- People have died.
- That's what people do!

1227
01:24:13,641 --> 01:24:16,681
- I will stop you.
- No, you won't.

1228
01:24:17,161 --> 01:24:18,161
Are you all right?

1229
01:24:20,481 --> 01:24:23,161
You can talk, Johnny boy.
Go ahead.

1230
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:25,801
Take it.

1231
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,001
Oh...

1232
01:24:29,081 --> 01:24:33,441
...that?
The missile plans.

1233
01:24:36,761 --> 01:24:38,281
Boring!

1234
01:24:38,601 --> 01:24:41,201
I could have got
them anywhere.

1235
01:24:41,281 --> 01:24:42,921
Sherlock, run!

1236
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:46,361
Good!

1237
01:24:46,761 --> 01:24:48,681
Very good.

1238
01:24:49,641 --> 01:24:53,721
If your sniper pulls that trigger,
Mr Moriarty, then we both go up.

1239
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:56,521
Isn't he sweet? I can see
why you like having him around.

1240
01:24:56,601 --> 01:25:00,281
But then, people do get
so sentimental about their pets.

1241
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:03,401
They're so touchingly loyal.
But oops!

1242
01:25:05,361 --> 01:25:08,201
You've rather shown
your hand there, Dr Watson.

1243
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:14,001
Gotcha.

1244
01:25:18,921 --> 01:25:19,721
Westwood.

1245
01:25:20,481 --> 01:25:24,161
Do you know what happens if you
don't leave me alone, Sherlock? To you?

1246
01:25:24,561 --> 01:25:26,961
Oh, let me guess.
I get killed.

1247
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:28,481
Kill you?

1248
01:25:29,241 --> 01:25:32,921
No, don't be obvious. I mean,
I'm going to kill you anyway, some day.

1249
01:25:33,281 --> 01:25:36,401
I don't want to rush it, though.
I'm saving it up for something special.

1250
01:25:36,481 --> 01:25:40,241
No, no, no, no, no.
If you don't stop prying...

1251
01:25:41,841 --> 01:25:43,081
...I'll burn you.

1252
01:25:45,481 --> 01:25:50,041
I'll burn the heart
out of you.

1253
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:54,641
I have been reliably informed
that I don't have one.

1254
01:25:54,721 --> 01:25:56,881
But we both know
that's not quite true.

1255
01:26:00,361 --> 01:26:03,041
Well, I'd better be off.

1256
01:26:04,241 --> 01:26:07,041
Well, so nice to have had
a proper chat.

1257
01:26:07,681 --> 01:26:10,721
What if I was to shoot you now?
Right now?

1258
01:26:10,801 --> 01:26:14,841
Then you could cherish
the look of surprise on my face.

1259
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:19,361
Cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock.
Really, I would.

1260
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:21,641
And just a teensy bit...

1261
01:26:22,161 --> 01:26:23,921
...disappointed.

1262
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:29,081
And of course, you wouldn't be able
to cherish it for very long.

1263
01:26:30,481 --> 01:26:31,681
Ciao...

1264
01:26:32,201 --> 01:26:34,001
...Sherlock Holmes.

1265
01:26:35,721 --> 01:26:37,481
Catch you...

1266
01:26:39,241 --> 01:26:40,481
...later.

1267
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:43,121
No, you won't!

1268
01:26:49,281 --> 01:26:50,601
All right?

1269
01:26:51,281 --> 01:26:54,281
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1270
01:26:54,361 --> 01:26:56,361
I'm fine. Sherlock...

1271
01:26:57,161 --> 01:26:58,481
Sherlock!

1272
01:27:04,361 --> 01:27:06,001
Oh, Christ.

1273
01:27:15,761 --> 01:27:20,041
- Are you OK?
- Me? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Fine.

1274
01:27:22,521 --> 01:27:23,921
That, er...

1275
01:27:24,801 --> 01:27:30,601
...thing that you... that you did, that,
um... you offered to do, that was, um...

1276
01:27:31,961 --> 01:27:33,361
...good.

1277
01:27:34,001 --> 01:27:35,801
I'm glad no-one saw that.

1278
01:27:37,241 --> 01:27:40,601
You ripping my clothes off
in a darkened swimming pool.

1279
01:27:40,681 --> 01:27:42,041
People might talk.

1280
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:44,721
They do little else.

1281
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:52,681
- Oh...
- Sorry, boys.

1282
01:27:52,761 --> 01:27:55,561
I'm so changeable!

1283
01:27:55,961 --> 01:27:58,801
It is a weakness with me,
but to be fair to myself...

1284
01:27:58,881 --> 01:28:00,481
...it is my only weakness.

1285
01:28:00,881 --> 01:28:03,641
You can't be allowed
to continue.

1286
01:28:04,121 --> 01:28:05,921
You just can't.

1287
01:28:06,001 --> 01:28:08,481
I would try
to convince you, but...

1288
01:28:08,561 --> 01:28:13,121
...everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

1289
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:20,321
Probably my answer
has crossed yours.
