1
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:31,201
How's your blog going?

2
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,041
Yeah, good.

3
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,521
Very good.

4
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:40,881
- You haven't written a word, have you?
- You just wrote "still has trust issues".

5
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:43,881
And you read
my writing upside down.

6
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:47,361
You see what I mean?

7
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:49,481
John...

8
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:52,681
...you're a soldier.

9
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:56,361
And it's going to take you
a while to adjust to civilian life...

10
00:01:56,441 --> 00:02:02,121
...and writing a blog about everything
that happens to you will honestly help you.

11
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,241
Nothing happens to me.

12
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:46,681
- What do you mean, there's no ruddy car?
- He went to Waterloo, I'm sorry. Get a cab!

13
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:48,321
I never get cabs!

14
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:52,121
- I love you.
- When?

15
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:54,321
Get a cab!

16
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:15,881
My husband...

17
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:20,161
...was a happy man
who lived life to the full.

18
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:23,641
He loved his family
and his work.

19
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:28,681
And that he should have taken
his own life in this way...

20
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,801
...is a mystery...

21
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:34,721
...and a shock
to all who knew him.

22
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:48,721
Yes, yes! Taxi!

23
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:54,921
- I'll be back in two minutes, mate.
- What?

24
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,001
- I'm just going home to get my umbrella.
- You can share mine.

25
00:03:58,081 --> 00:03:59,841
Two minutes, all right?

26
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,201
- She still dancing?
- Yeah, if you can call it that.

27
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:42,161
- Did you get the car keys off her?
- Got them out of her bag.

28
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:43,921
Where is she?

29
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:02,001
The body of Beth Davenport,
Junior Minister for Transport...

30
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:05,841
...was found late last night
on a building site in Greater London.

31
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:09,401
Preliminary investigations suggest
that this was suicide.

32
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:13,241
We can confirm that this apparent
suicide closely resembles those...

33
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:16,641
...of Sir Jeffrey Patterson
and James Phillimore.

34
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,801
In the light of this, these incidents
are now being treated as linked.

35
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:22,601
The investigation is ongoing,
but Detective Inspector Lestrade...

36
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:24,761
...will take questions now.

37
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,201
Detective Inspector,
how can suicides be linked?

38
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:30,361
Well, they all took
the same poison.

39
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:34,161
They were all found in places
they had no reason to be.

40
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:37,801
- None of them had shown any prior indicat...
- But you can't have serial suicides.

41
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,281
Well, apparently you can.

42
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:41,401
These three people,
there's nothing that links them?

43
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:46,761
There's no link we've found yet, but we're
looking for it. There has to be one.

44
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:56,161
- If you've all got texts, please ignore them.
- It just says "wrong".

45
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:57,441
Well, just ignore that.

46
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:59,921
If there are no more questions
for Detective Inspector Lestrade...

47
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:01,521
...I'm going to bring
this session to an end.

48
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:04,201
If they're suicides,
what are you investigating?

49
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:09,081
As I say,
these suicides are clearly linked.

50
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:14,281
It's an unusual situation.
We've got our best people investigating.

51
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,041
Says "wrong" again.

52
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:23,241
One more question.
Is there any chance that these are murders?

53
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:26,441
And if they are,
is this the work of a serial killer?

54
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:30,521
I know that you like writing about these,
but these do appear to be suicides.

55
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:34,481
We know the difference.
The poison was clearly self-administered.

56
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,001
Yes, but if they are murders,
how do people keep themselves safe?

57
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:39,641
Well, don't commit suicide.

58
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:41,841
Daily Mail.

59
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:44,521
Obviously, this is
a frightening time for people...

60
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:49,761
...but all anyone has to do
is exercise reasonable precautions.

61
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:52,681
We are all as safe
as we want to be.

62
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:01,881
Thank you.

63
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:08,721
You've got to stop him doing that.
He's making us look like idiots.

64
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:12,641
If you can tell me how he does it,
I'll stop him.

65
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:24,561
John!

66
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:25,681
John Watson!

67
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:29,481
Stamford, Mike Stamford.
We were at Barts together.

68
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:31,641
Yes, sorry, yes,
Mike, hello.

69
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:34,361
- Yeah, I know, I got fat.
- No, no.

70
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:37,041
I heard you were abroad somewhere
getting shot at. What happened?

71
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:39,561
I got shot.

72
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:48,521
- Are you still at Barts, then?
- Teaching now, yeah.

73
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,961
Bright young things like we used to be.
God, I hate them.

74
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,521
What about you? Just staying in town
till you get yourself sorted?

75
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,321
I can't afford London
on an Army pension.

76
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:00,721
You couldn't bear to be anywhere else.
That's not the John Watson I know.

77
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,001
Yeah, I'm not
the John Watson...

78
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,481
Couldn't Harry help?

79
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,681
Yeah, like that's going
to happen.

80
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:16,361
- I don't know, get a flatshare or something?
- Come on, who'd want me for a flatmate?

81
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:20,401
What?

82
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:23,561
You're the second person
to say that to me today.

83
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,241
Who was the first?

84
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:32,681
- How fresh?
- Just in. 67, natural causes.

85
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,801
Used to work here.
I knew him, he was nice.

86
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:38,041
Fine.

87
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:40,241
We'll start with
the riding crop.

88
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:52,361
So...

89
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:54,001
Bad day, was it?

90
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:56,641
I need to know what bruises form
in the next 20 minutes.

91
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:59,081
A man's alibi depends on it.
Text me.

92
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:02,321
Listen, I was wondering.
Maybe later, when you're finished...

93
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:05,201
You're wearing lipstick.
You weren't wearing lipstick before.

94
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:08,441
I, er...
I refreshed it a bit.

95
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,801
- Sorry, you were saying?
- I was wondering if you'd like to have coffee.

96
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:16,561
Black, two sugars, please.
I'll be upstairs.

97
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,081
OK.

98
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:35,001
- Bit different from my day.
- You've no idea!

99
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:37,401
Mike, can I borrow your phone?
There's no signal on mine.

100
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:40,281
- And what's wrong with the landline?
- I prefer to text.

101
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:43,001
Sorry,
it's in my coat.

102
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:45,601
Er, here...

103
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,241
Use mine.

104
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,681
Oh... thank you.

105
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:53,241
This is an old friend of mine,
John Watson.

106
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:58,281
Afghanistan or Iraq?

107
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:03,481
- Sorry?
- Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq?

108
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:10,881
- Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you...?
- Ah, Molly, coffee, thank you.

109
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,161
- What happened to the lipstick?
- It wasn't working for me.

110
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:18,561
Really? I thought it was a big improvement.
Your mouth's too small now.

111
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:20,081
OK.

112
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:23,801
How do you feel
about the violin?

113
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,841
I'm sorry, what?

114
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:31,681
I play the violin when I'm thinking
and sometimes I don't talk for days on end.

115
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:35,721
Would that bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each other.

116
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:39,401
- You told him about me?
- Not a word.

117
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:42,161
- Who said anything about flatmates?
- I did.

118
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,721
Told Mike this morning I must be
a difficult man to find a flatmate for.

119
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:47,401
Now here he is,
just after lunch...

120
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,361
...with an old friend clearly just home
from military service in Afghanistan.

121
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:54,001
- Wasn't a difficult leap.
- How did you know about Afghanistan?

122
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:56,281
Got my eye on a nice little place
in central London.

123
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:58,081
We ought to be able
to afford it.

124
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:00,961
We'll meet there tomorrow evening,
seven o'clock. Sorry, got to dash.

125
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,761
I think I left my riding crop
in the mortuary.

126
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:05,601
Is that it?

127
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:07,441
Is that what?

128
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:11,281
We've only just met
and we're going to go and look at a flat?

129
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:13,401
Problem?

130
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:17,601
We don't know a thing about each other.
I don't know where we're meeting.

131
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:19,521
I don't even know
your name.

132
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:23,481
I know you're an Army doctor and you've
been invalided home from Afghanistan.

133
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:26,041
You've got a brother worried about you,
but you won't go to him for help...

134
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:28,921
...because you don't approve of him,
possibly because he's an alcoholic...

135
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:31,401
...more likely because
he recently walked out on his wife.

136
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:33,761
And I know your therapist thinks
your limp's psychosomatic...

137
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:35,921
...quite correctly,
I'm afraid.

138
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:38,521
That's enough to be going on with,
don't you think?

139
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,441
The name's Sherlock Holmes,
and the address is 221B Baker Street.

140
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:48,241
Afternoon.

141
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:53,921
Yeah,
he's always like that.

142
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:00,041
Hello.

143
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:03,281
- Ah, Mr Holmes.
- Sherlock, please.

144
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:06,281
Well, this is a prime spot.
Must be expensive.

145
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:09,281
Mrs Hudson, the landlady,
she's given me a special deal.

146
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:10,681
Owes me a favour.

147
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:14,361
A few years back, her husband
got himself sentenced to death in Florida.

148
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:15,361
I was able to help out.

149
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:18,161
Sorry, you stopped her husband
being executed?

150
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:20,161
Oh, no, I ensured it.

151
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:22,641
Sherlock!

152
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,961
Mrs Hudson,
Dr John Watson.

153
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,041
- Hello. Come in.
- Thank you.

154
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:28,481
Shall we...?

155
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:56,361
Well, this could be
very nice.

156
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:00,001
- Very nice indeed.
- Yes.

157
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,721
Yes, I think so,
my thoughts precisely.

158
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,321
- So I went straight ahead and moved in.
- Soon as we get this rubbish cleaned up.

159
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:12,001
- So this is all...
- Well, obviously I can...

160
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:14,961
...straighten things up a bit.

161
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:18,121
- That's a skull.
- Friend of mine.

162
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:19,681
When I say friend...

163
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:22,561
What do you think, then,
Dr Watson?

164
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:26,801
There's another bedroom upstairs,
if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

165
00:14:26,881 --> 00:14:28,721
Of course
we'll be needing two.

166
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:33,561
Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts round here.
Mrs Turner next door's got married ones.

167
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:39,961
Sherlock!
The mess you've made.

168
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:49,841
I looked you up
on the internet last night.

169
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:52,281
Anything interesting?

170
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:55,121
Found your website.
The Science Of Deduction.

171
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:57,281
What did you think?

172
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:01,081
You said you could identify
a software designer by his tie...

173
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:03,241
...and an airline pilot
by his left thumb?

174
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,561
Yes.

175
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:07,241
And I can read your military career
in your face and your leg...

176
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:10,521
...and your brother's drinking habits
in your mobile phone.

177
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:11,561
How?

178
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:14,961
What about these suicides,
then, Sherlock?

179
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:19,961
I thought that'd be right up your street.
Three exactly the same.

180
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,361
Four.

181
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,801
There's been a fourth.
And there's something different this time.

182
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:26,921
A fourth?

183
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,481
- Where?
- Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.

184
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:35,361
What's new about this one?
You wouldn't have come to me otherwise.

185
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:38,041
You know how they never leave notes?
This one did.

186
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:40,041
Will you come?

187
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:41,961
- Who's on forensics?
- Anderson.

188
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:44,281
He doesn't work well
with me.

189
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,201
- Well, he won't be your assistant.
- I need an assistant.

190
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,921
- Will you come?
- Not in a police car, I'll be right behind.

191
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:51,921
Thank you.

192
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:02,441
Brilliant! Yes!

193
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:06,841
Four serial suicides and now a note.
Oh, it's Christmas.

194
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:09,641
Mrs Hudson, I'll be late.
Might need some food.

195
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:12,201
I'm your landlady, dear,
not your housekeeper.

196
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:16,041
Something cold will do. John,
have a cup of tea, make yourself at home.

197
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:17,801
Don't wait up!

198
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:20,281
Look at him,
dashing about...

199
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,721
My husband
was just the same.

200
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:27,041
But you're more
the sitting-down type, I can tell.

201
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:29,361
I'll make you that cuppa,
you rest your leg.

202
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:34,881
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry.
It's just sometimes this bloody thing...

203
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:39,441
- I understand, dear, I've got a hip.
- Cup of tea'd be lovely. Thank you.

204
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:41,801
Just this once, dear,
I'm not your housekeeper.

205
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:46,401
- Couple of biscuits too, if you've got 'em.
- Not your housekeeper!

206
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:50,921
You're a doctor.

207
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,561
In fact,
you're an Army doctor.

208
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:56,161
Yes.

209
00:16:56,961 --> 00:16:58,401
Any good?

210
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,441
Very good.

211
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:04,241
Seen a lot of injuries, then.
Violent deaths.

212
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:05,921
Well, yes.

213
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,441
- Bit of trouble too, I bet?
- Of course. Yes.

214
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:12,161
Enough for a lifetime,
far too much.

215
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:16,161
- Want to see some more?
- Oh, God, yes.

216
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,961
Sorry, Mrs Hudson,
I'll skip the tea. Off out.

217
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,161
- Both of you?
- Impossible suicides? Four of them?

218
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:29,321
No point sitting at home when
there's finally something fun going on!

219
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:32,681
- Look at you, all happy. It's not decent.
- Who cares about decent?

220
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,361
The game,
Mrs Hudson, is on!

221
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:42,281
Taxi!

222
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:21,681
- OK, you've got questions...
- Yeah, where are we going?

223
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,681
Crime scene. Next?

224
00:18:25,281 --> 00:18:27,601
- Who are you? What do you do?
- What do you think?

225
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:30,801
- I'd say... private detective.
- But...?

226
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,561
But the police don't go
to private detectives.

227
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:37,241
I'm a consulting detective.
Only one in the world. I invented the job.

228
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:38,481
What does that mean?

229
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:42,281
It means when the police are out of their
depth, which is always, they consult me.

230
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:45,081
The police
don't consult amateurs.

231
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:50,561
When I met you for the first time
yesterday, I said Afghanistan or Iraq.

232
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,161
- You looked surprised.
- Yes, how did you know?

233
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:53,681
I didn't know, I saw.

234
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:58,401
Your haircut, the way you hold yourself
says military. But your conversation...

235
00:18:58,481 --> 00:18:59,881
Bit different from my day.

236
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:02,841
...said trained at Barts -
so Army doctor, obvious.

237
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:05,761
Your face is tanned...

238
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:09,161
...but no tan above the wrists.
You've been abroad, but not sunbathing.

239
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:11,601
Your limp's bad when you walk, but you
don't ask for a chair when you stand.

240
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:15,001
Like you've forgotten about it,
so it's at least partly psychosomatic.

241
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:17,961
That says the original circumstances
of the injury were traumatic.

242
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:23,361
Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action,
suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.

243
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:24,921
You said
I had a therapist.

244
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:28,121
You've got a psychosomatic limp,
of course you've got a therapist.

245
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:32,401
Then there's your brother. Your phone.
It's expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player.

246
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:35,321
You're looking for a flatshare.
You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift.

247
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:37,601
Scratches.
Not one, many over time.

248
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:39,281
It's been in the same pocket
as keys and coins.

249
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:41,641
You wouldn't treat
your one luxury item like this.

250
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:45,521
So it's had a previous owner.
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

251
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,401
The engraving?

252
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:49,441
Harry Watson. Clearly a family member
who's given you his old phone.

253
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,601
Not your father,
this is a young man's gadget.

254
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:54,601
Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero
who can't find a place to live.

255
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:57,561
Unlikely you've got an extended family,
not one you're close to.

256
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:02,121
So brother it is. Now, who's Clara? Three
kisses says it's a romantic attachment.

257
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,801
The expense of the phone
says wife, not girlfriend.

258
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:07,321
Must have given it to him recently,
the model's only six months old.

259
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:09,681
Marriage in trouble, then -
six months on he's given it away.

260
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:12,001
If she'd left him,
he would have kept it. Sentiment.

261
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:14,401
No, he wanted rid of it.
He left her.

262
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,801
He gave the phone to you,
so he wants you to stay in touch.

263
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:20,681
You're looking for cheap accommodation,
but not going to your brother for help.

264
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,481
That says you've got problems with him.
Maybe you liked his wife.

265
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:24,961
Maybe you don't like
his drinking.

266
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,721
How can you possibly know
about the drinking?

267
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:30,801
Shot in the dark.
Good one, though.

268
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:33,081
Power connection -
tiny little scuff marks round the edge.

269
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:35,641
Every night he plugs it in to charge,
but his hands are shaking.

270
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:37,521
You never see those marks
on a sober man's phone...

271
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:40,001
...never see a drunk's without them.
There you go, you were right.

272
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:45,361
- I was right? Right about what?
- The police don't consult amateurs.

273
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,441
That...

274
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:50,441
...was amazing.

275
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:57,161
- Do you think so?
- Of course. It was quite extraordinary.

276
00:20:57,241 --> 00:21:00,121
- That's not what people normally say.
- What do people normally say?

277
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:01,561
Piss off!

278
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:15,721
Did I get anything wrong?

279
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:18,921
Harry and me don't get on,
never have.

280
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:24,201
Clara and Harry split up three months ago
and they're getting a divorce.

281
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,481
- And Harry is a drinker.
- Spot on, then.

282
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:30,841
- I didn't expect to be right about everything.
- Harry's short for Harriet.

283
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:34,081
- Harry's your sister.
- What am I supposed to be doing here?

284
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:36,561
- Sister!
- No, seriously, what am I doing here?

285
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:38,481
There's always something.

286
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:39,961
Hello, freak!

287
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,121
I'm here to see
Detective Inspector Lestrade.

288
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,921
- Why?
- I was invited.

289
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,921
- Why?
- I think he wants me to take a look.

290
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:50,481
- You know what I think, don't you?
- Always, Sally.

291
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:53,201
I even know
you didn't make it home last night.

292
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:55,841
- Er... who's this?
- Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

293
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:59,721
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.
Old friend.

294
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:03,121
A colleague?
How do you get a colleague?

295
00:22:03,201 --> 00:22:04,681
Did he follow you home?

296
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:07,601
- Would it be better if I just waited...?
- No.

297
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:10,641
Freak's here.
Bringing him in.

298
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:22,081
Ah, Anderson.
Here we are again.

299
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,201
It's a crime scene.
I don't want it contaminated.

300
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:28,201
- Are we clear on that?
- Quite clear.

301
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:31,641
- And is your wife away for long?
- Oh, don't pretend you worked that out.

302
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:34,481
- Somebody told you that.
- Your deodorant told me that.

303
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,681
- My deodorant?
- It's for men.

304
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:38,961
Well, of course it's for men.
I'm wearing it.

305
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,241
So's Sergeant Donovan.

306
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:44,281
Ooh... I think it just vaporised.
May I go in?

307
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:47,321
- Whatever you're trying to imply...
- I'm not implying anything.

308
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:51,921
I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little
chat and just happened to stay over.

309
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:57,121
And I assume she scrubbed your floors,
going by the state of her knees.

310
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:10,121
- You'll need to wear one of these.
- Who's this?

311
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:11,321
He's with me.

312
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:14,881
- But who is he?
- I said he's with me.

313
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,641
Aren't you going
to put one on?

314
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:24,121
- So where are we?
- Upstairs.

315
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:33,721
I can give you
two minutes.

316
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:35,441
May need longer.

317
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:38,641
Her name's Jennifer Wilson,
according to her credit cards.

318
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:41,361
We're running them now
for contact details.

319
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,241
Hasn't been here long.

320
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,321
Some kids found her.

321
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:19,561
Shut up.

322
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:22,641
- I didn't say anything.
- You were thinking. It's annoying.

323
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,081
Got anything?

324
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,241
- Not much.
- She's German.

325
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,721
"Rache".
It's German for revenge.

326
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:46,801
- She could be trying to tell us...
- Yes, thank you for your input.

327
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:48,801
- So she's German?
- Of course she's not.

328
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,001
She's from out of town, though.
Intended to stay in London for one night...

329
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:55,041
...before returning home to Cardiff -
so far, so obvious.

330
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,881
- Sorry, obvious?
- What about the message, though?

331
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:58,481
Dr Watson,
what do you think?

332
00:25:59,081 --> 00:26:00,801
- Of the message?
- Of the body. You're a medical man.

333
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:03,241
- We have a whole team outside.
- They won't work with me.

334
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:08,001
- I'm breaking every rule letting you in here...
- Yes, because you need me.

335
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:10,561
Yes, I do.

336
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,561
God help me.

337
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:14,321
Dr Watson!

338
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:18,161
Oh, do as he says.
Help yourself.

339
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:23,961
Anderson, keep everyone out
for a couple of minutes...

340
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:27,241
- Well?
- What am I doing here?

341
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:29,841
- Helping me make a point.
- I'm supposed to help you pay the rent.

342
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,281
- This is more fun.
- Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

343
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:36,881
Perfectly sound analysis,
but I was hoping you'd go deeper.

344
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:56,601
Yeah...

345
00:26:56,961 --> 00:27:00,681
Asphyxiation... probably.
Passed out, choked on her own vomit.

346
00:27:00,761 --> 00:27:04,161
Can't smell any alcohol on her. It could
have been a seizure. Possibly drugs.

347
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:06,561
You know what it was,
you've read the papers.

348
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:08,961
Well, she's one of the suicides.
The fourth...?

349
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:11,721
Sherlock, two minutes, I said.
I need anything you've got.

350
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:14,841
Victim is in her late 30s.
Professional person, going by her clothes.

351
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:18,241
I'm guessing something in the media, going
by the frankly alarming shade of pink.

352
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:20,721
Travelled from Cardiff today, intending
to stay in London for one night...

353
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:22,481
...from the size
of her suitcase.

354
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:23,801
- Suitcase?
- Yes.

355
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:26,641
She's been married
at least ten years, but not happily.

356
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:29,441
She's had a string of lovers,
but none of them knew she was married.

357
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:31,601
Oh, for God's sake,
if you're just making this up...

358
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:34,201
Her wedding ring.
Ten years old at least.

359
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:37,081
The rest of her jewellery has been regularly
cleaned, but not her wedding ring.

360
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:38,601
State of her marriage
right there.

361
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:41,681
The inside is shinier than the outside,
so it's regularly removed.

362
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:44,041
The only polishing it gets
is when she works it off her finger.

363
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,601
It's not for work, look at her nails.
She doesn't work with her hands.

364
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:49,441
So what or who does she remove
her rings for?

365
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:52,561
Not one lover, she'd never sustain
the fiction of being single for that long.

366
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:55,841
- So more likely a string of them. Simple.
- That's brilliant.

367
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:57,561
- Sorry.
- Cardiff?

368
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:00,841
- It's obvious, isn't it?
- It's not obvious to me.

369
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:05,281
Dear God, what is it like in your funny
little brains? It must be so boring.

370
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:08,641
Her coat, it's slightly damp, she's been
in heavy rain in the last few hours.

371
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,481
No rain anywhere in London
in that time.

372
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:14,201
Under her coat collar is damp too.
She's turned it up against the wind.

373
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:16,961
She's got an umbrella in her pocket,
but it's dry and unused.

374
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,361
Not just wind, strong wind,
too strong to use her umbrella.

375
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:23,081
We know from her suitcase
that she was intending to stay overnight.

376
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:26,001
She can't have travelled more than 2 or 3
hours, 'cause her coat still hasn't dried.

377
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:28,521
So, where has there been
heavy rain and strong wind...

378
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:32,041
...within the radius
of that travel time? Cardiff.

379
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:34,361
- That's fantastic.
- Do you know you do that out loud?

380
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:36,961
- Sorry, I'll shut up.
- No, it's... fine.

381
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:40,001
- Why do you keep saying suitcase?
- Yes, where is it?

382
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:43,721
She must have had a phone or an organiser.
Find out who Rachel is.

383
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:45,041
She was writing Rachel?

384
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:47,121
No, she was leaving
an angry note in German!

385
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:49,481
Of course she was writing Rachel,
no other word it can be.

386
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,121
But why did she wait
until she was dying to write it?

387
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:53,641
How do you know
she had a suitcase?

388
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:57,201
Tiny splash marks on her right heel
and calf not present on the left.

389
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:59,441
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase
behind her with her right hand.

390
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,281
Don't get that splash pattern
any other way.

391
00:29:01,361 --> 00:29:03,401
Smallish case,
going by the spread.

392
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:05,441
Case that size,
woman this clothes-conscious...

393
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:07,761
...could only be an overnight bag
so we know she was staying one night.

394
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:11,481
- Where is it? What have you done with it?
- There wasn't a case.

395
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,161
- Say that again.
- There wasn't a case.

396
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:19,921
- There was never any suitcase.
- Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase?

397
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:23,481
- Was there a suitcase in this house?
- Sherlock, there was no case!

398
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,241
But they take the poison themselves,
they swallow the pills.

399
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:28,521
There are clear signs,
even you lot couldn't miss them.

400
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,881
Right, thanks. And...?

401
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:32,841
It's murder, all of them.
I don't know how.

402
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:35,281
But they're not suicides,
they're serial killings.

403
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:38,721
We've got a serial killer. Love those.
There's always something to look forward to.

404
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:40,761
- Why are you saying that?
- Her case!

405
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:43,401
Come on, where is her case?
Did she eat it?

406
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,841
Someone else was here
and they took her case.

407
00:29:46,921 --> 00:29:49,801
So the killer must have driven here.
Forgot the case was in the car.

408
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:51,961
She could have checked
into a hotel, left it there.

409
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,441
No, she never got to the hotel.
Look at her hair.

410
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:56,161
She colour-coordinates
her lipstick and shoes.

411
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:59,761
She'd never have left any hotel
with her hair still looking...

412
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:01,081
Oh...

413
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:03,761
Oh!

414
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:05,321
Sherlock?
What is it, what?

415
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:08,921
Serial killers, always hard. You have
to wait for them to make a mistake.

416
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:10,761
- We can't just wait!
- We're done waiting.

417
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:13,401
Look at her, really look!
Houston, we have a mistake.

418
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:14,601
Get on to Cardiff.

419
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:17,681
Find out who Jennifer Wilson's family
and friends were. Find Rachel!

420
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:19,601
Of course, yeah.
But what mistake?

421
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:22,441
Pink!

422
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:26,081
Let's get on with it...

423
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:05,641
- He's gone.
- Who, Sherlock Holmes?

424
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:07,881
Yeah, he just took off.
He does that.

425
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:11,041
- Is he coming back?
- Didn't look like it.

426
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:12,441
Right.

427
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,481
Right...

428
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:19,201
Yes.
Sorry, where am I?

429
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:21,281
Brixton.

430
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:25,841
Do you know where I could get a cab?
It's just, er...

431
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:27,761
Well...

432
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:29,721
...my leg.

433
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:34,681
Try the main road.

434
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:35,841
Thanks.

435
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:38,521
But you're not his friend.

436
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:40,881
He doesn't have friends.

437
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:43,521
So who are you?

438
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,361
I'm... I'm nobody.
I just met him.

439
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:48,441
OK, bit of advice, then.
Stay away from that guy.

440
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:49,921
Why?

441
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:54,361
You know why he's here?

442
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:57,801
He's not paid or anything.

443
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:01,081
He likes it.
He gets off on it.

444
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:04,601
The weirder the crime, the more
he gets off. And you know what?

445
00:32:05,601 --> 00:32:07,841
One day just showing up
won't be enough.

446
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:10,961
One day we'll be standing round a body,
and he'll be the one that put it there.

447
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:14,081
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a psychopath.

448
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:16,441
Psychopaths get bored.

449
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:18,601
- Donovan!
- Coming.

450
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:25,081
Stay away
from Sherlock Holmes.

451
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:57,641
Taxi! Taxi...

452
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:34,041
Hello?

453
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:37,761
There is a security camera
on the building to your left.

454
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:39,401
Do you see it?

455
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:44,641
Who's this?

456
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,081
Who's speaking?

457
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:50,041
Do you see the camera,
Dr Watson?

458
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:53,361
- Yeah, I see it.
- Watch...

459
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:02,281
There is another camera on the building
opposite you. Do you see it?

460
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:09,561
And finally, at the top
of the building on your right.

461
00:34:16,561 --> 00:34:18,161
How are you doing this?

462
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:23,241
Get into the car, Dr Watson.
I would make some sort of threat.

463
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:27,041
But I'm sure your situation
is quite clear to you.

464
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,441
- Hello.
- Hi.

465
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:52,801
What's your name, then?

466
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:55,121
Er... Anthea.

467
00:34:55,841 --> 00:34:58,641
- Is that your real name?
- No.

468
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,201
I'm John.

469
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:05,801
Yes. I know.

470
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:12,881
Any point in asking
where I'm going?

471
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:16,681
None at all...

472
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,601
...John.

473
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,521
OK.

474
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:42,121
Have a seat, John.

475
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:49,081
You know,
I've got a phone.

476
00:35:49,721 --> 00:35:52,161
I mean,
very clever and all that.

477
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:53,881
But, er...

478
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,681
...you could just phone me.

479
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:58,801
On my phone.

480
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:03,801
When one is avoiding the attention
of Sherlock Holmes...

481
00:36:03,881 --> 00:36:06,281
...one learns to be discreet,
hence this place.

482
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:09,401
Your leg must be hurting you.
Sit down.

483
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,401
I don't want to sit down.

484
00:36:12,521 --> 00:36:15,801
- You don't seem very afraid.
- You don't seem very frightening.

485
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,281
Yes...

486
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:20,881
The bravery of the soldier.

487
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:25,241
Bravery is by far the kindest word
for stupidity, don't you think?

488
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:27,521
What is your connection
to Sherlock Holmes?

489
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:33,961
I don't have one. I barely know him.
I met him... yesterday.

490
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:35,961
Mmm, and since yesterday,
you've moved in with him...

491
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:38,321
...and now you're
solving crimes together.

492
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:41,601
Might we expect a happy announcement
by the end of the week?

493
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:44,201
- Who are you?
- An interested party.

494
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:46,121
Interested in Sherlock?
Why?

495
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:49,681
- I'm guessing you're not friends.
- You've met him.

496
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:51,681
How many friends
do you imagine he has?

497
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:56,601
I am the closest thing to a friend that
Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.

498
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,761
- And what's that?
- An enemy.

499
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,801
- An enemy?
- In his mind, certainly.

500
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:04,401
If you were to ask him,
he'd probably say his arch-enemy.

501
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:06,361
He does love
to be dramatic.

502
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:09,641
Well, thank God
you're above all that.

503
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:19,361
- I hope I'm not distracting you.
- Not distracting me at all.

504
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:22,481
Do you plan to continue your association
with Sherlock Holmes?

505
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:26,281
I could be wrong,
but I think that's none of your business.

506
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:29,481
- It could be.
- It really couldn't.

507
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:31,841
If you do move into, um...

508
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:42,201
...221B Baker Street, I'd be happy
to pay you a meaningful sum of money...

509
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:44,961
...on a regular basis
to ease your way.

510
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:47,881
- Why?
- Because you're not a wealthy man.

511
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:49,521
In exchange for what?

512
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:51,841
Information.

513
00:37:52,241 --> 00:37:55,841
Nothing indiscreet.
Nothing you'd feel... uncomfortable with.

514
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:58,481
- Just tell me what he's up to.
- Why?

515
00:37:59,121 --> 00:38:01,281
I worry about him.

516
00:38:01,721 --> 00:38:02,961
Constantly.

517
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:04,561
That's nice of you.

518
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:09,041
But I would prefer for various reasons
that my concern go unmentioned.

519
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:13,281
We have what you might call a...
difficult relationship.

520
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:22,121
- No.
- But I haven't mentioned a figure.

521
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:25,801
- Don't bother.
- You're very loyal very quickly.

522
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:28,721
No, I'm not,
I'm just not interested.

523
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:35,601
"Trust issues",
it says here.

524
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:40,441
What's that?

525
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:44,161
Could it be that you've decided to trust
Sherlock Holmes of all people?

526
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,201
Who says I trust him?

527
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,441
You don't seem the kind
to make friends easily.

528
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:49,041
Are we done?

529
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:51,281
You tell me.

530
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:01,441
I imagine people have already warned you
to stay away from him...

531
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:04,721
...but I can see from your left hand
that's not going to happen.

532
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,321
- My what?
- Show me.

533
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:22,241
Don't...

534
00:39:30,881 --> 00:39:32,241
- Remarkable.
- What is?

535
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:39,481
Most people blunder round this city and all
they see are streets and shops and cars.

536
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:42,281
When you walk with Sherlock Holmes,
you see the battlefield.

537
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:45,801
- You've seen it already, haven't you?
- What's wrong with my hand?

538
00:39:46,681 --> 00:39:50,041
You have an intermittent tremor
in your left hand.

539
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,361
Your therapist thinks
it's post-traumatic stress disorder.

540
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:56,161
She thinks you're haunted by memories
of your military service.

541
00:39:56,241 --> 00:39:58,001
Who the hell are you?

542
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:03,241
- How do you know that?
- Fire her. She's got it the wrong way round.

543
00:40:03,321 --> 00:40:06,921
You're under stress right now,
and your hand is perfectly steady.

544
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:12,281
You're not haunted by the war,
Dr Watson...

545
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:14,081
You miss it.

546
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,921
Welcome back.

547
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:27,361
Time to choose a side,
Dr Watson.

548
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:39,281
I'm to take you home.

549
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:50,121
Address?

550
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:51,841
Er, Baker Street.

551
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:55,041
221B Baker Street.

552
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:58,481
But I need
to stop off somewhere first.

553
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:30,041
Listen, your boss. Any chance you could
not tell him this is where I went?

554
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,601
- Sure.
- You've told him already, haven't you?

555
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:34,081
Yeah.

556
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:41,281
Hey, um...
do you ever get any free time?

557
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:44,121
Oh, yeah. Lots.

558
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:51,121
- Bye.
- OK.

559
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:23,121
- What are you doing?
- Nicotine patch.

560
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:25,081
Helps me think.

561
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:29,361
Impossible to sustain a smoking habit
in London these days.

562
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:31,001
Bad news for brain work.

563
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,921
- It's good news for breathing.
- Oh, breathing! Breathing's boring.

564
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:37,721
- Is that... three patches?
- It's a three-patch problem.

565
00:42:41,921 --> 00:42:43,041
Well...?

566
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:48,041
You asked me to come,
I'm assuming it's important.

567
00:42:49,321 --> 00:42:52,241
Oh, yeah, of course.
Can I borrow your phone?

568
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:54,001
- My phone?
- I don't use mine.

569
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:56,401
Always a chance that my number
will be recognised. It's on the website.

570
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:58,241
- Mrs Hudson's got a phone.
- She's downstairs.

571
00:42:58,321 --> 00:42:59,681
I shouted,
but she didn't hear.

572
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:02,921
- I was the other side of London...
- There was no hurry.

573
00:43:06,361 --> 00:43:07,361
Here...

574
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:15,441
- So what's this about? The case?
- Her case...

575
00:43:15,521 --> 00:43:18,681
- Her case?
- Her suitcase, yes, obviously.

576
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:21,761
The murderer took her suitcase,
first big mistake.

577
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:23,801
OK, he took her case.
So?

578
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:27,481
It's no use, there's no other way.
We'll have to risk it.

579
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:30,521
On my desk there's a number.
I want you to send a text.

580
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:37,041
- You've brought me here... to send a text.
- Text, yes. The number on my desk.

581
00:43:49,241 --> 00:43:51,801
- What's wrong?
- Just met a friend of yours.

582
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:53,881
- A friend?
- An enemy.

583
00:43:53,961 --> 00:43:55,281
Oh. Which one?

584
00:43:57,121 --> 00:44:00,521
Your arch-enemy, according to him.
Do people have arch-enemies?

585
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:04,201
Did he offer you money
to spy on me?

586
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:05,721
Yes.

587
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:08,041
- Did you take it?
- No.

588
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:11,321
Pity, we could have split the fee.
Think it through next time.

589
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:12,441
Who is he?

590
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:15,161
The most dangerous man you've ever met
and not my problem right now.

591
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:17,041
On my desk, the number!

592
00:44:23,921 --> 00:44:27,961
Jennifer Wilson. That was...
Hang on. Wasn't that the dead woman?

593
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:31,321
Yes. That's not important.
Just enter the number.

594
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:32,801
- Are you doing it?
- Yes.

595
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:35,841
- Have you done it?
- Yeah, hang on!

596
00:44:36,281 --> 00:44:38,281
These words exactly.

597
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:44,201
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?
I must have blacked out.

598
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:48,001
22 Northumberland Street,
please come."

599
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:51,121
- You blacked out?
- What? No... No!

600
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:54,881
Type and send it.
Quickly.

601
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:00,841
- Have you sent it?
- What's the address?

602
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:03,321
22 Northumberland Street.
Hurry up!

603
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:12,081
That's...

604
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:15,841
That's the pink lady's case,
that's Jennifer Wilson's case.

605
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,161
Yes, obviously.

606
00:45:20,081 --> 00:45:22,841
Oh, perhaps I should mention -
I didn't kill her.

607
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,041
- I never said you did.
- Why not?

608
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:28,001
Given that text and the fact I have her
case, it's a perfectly logical assumption.

609
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:30,321
Do people usually assume
you're the murderer?

610
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:32,961
Now and then, yes.

611
00:45:34,281 --> 00:45:35,681
OK...

612
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:39,641
- How did you get this?
- By looking.

613
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:40,481
Where?

614
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:42,561
The killer must have driven her
to Lauriston Gardens.

615
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:45,441
He could only keep her case by accident
if it was in a car.

616
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:48,241
Nobody could be seen with this case
without drawing attention...

617
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:51,161
...particularly a man,
which is statistically more likely.

618
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:54,121
So obviously he'd feel compelled
to get rid of it.

619
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:57,401
Wouldn't have taken him more than
five minutes to realise his mistake.

620
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,321
I checked every backstreet
wide enough for a car...

621
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:01,561
...five minutes from
Lauriston Gardens and anywhere...

622
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:04,961
...you could dispose of a bulky object
without being observed.

623
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:09,081
Took me less than an hour
to find the right skip.

624
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,601
Pink. You got all that because
you realised the case would be pink?

625
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:15,961
- It had to be pink, obviously.
- Why didn't I think of that?

626
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:20,041
Because you're an idiot. No, no, don't
look like that. Practically everyone is.

627
00:46:20,121 --> 00:46:24,161
- Now, look. Do you see what's missing?
- From the case? How could I?

628
00:46:24,881 --> 00:46:26,841
Her phone.
Where's her mobile phone?

629
00:46:26,921 --> 00:46:28,641
There was no phone on the body,
there's no phone in the case.

630
00:46:28,721 --> 00:46:32,241
- We know she had one. You just texted it.
- Maybe she left it at home.

631
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:34,641
She has a string of lovers
and she's careful about it.

632
00:46:34,721 --> 00:46:37,521
She never leaves
her phone at home.

633
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,281
Er...

634
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:45,281
- Why did I just send that text?
- The question is where is her phone now?

635
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:48,641
- She could have lost it.
- Yes, or?

636
00:46:49,721 --> 00:46:52,721
The murderer... You think
the murderer has the phone?

637
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:58,121
Maybe she left it when she left her case.
Maybe he took it from her for some reason.

638
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:01,841
Either way, the balance of probability
is the murderer has her phone.

639
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:05,681
Sorry... What are we doing?
Did I just text a murderer?

640
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:07,081
What good will that do?

641
00:47:10,281 --> 00:47:13,201
A few hours after his last victim,
and now he receives a text...

642
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:15,681
...that can only be from her.

643
00:47:17,241 --> 00:47:19,601
If somebody had just found that phone,
they'd ignore a text like that.

644
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:21,441
But the murderer...

645
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:23,921
...would panic.

646
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:29,521
- Have you talked to the police?
- Four people are dead, there isn't time.

647
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:32,961
- So why are you talking to me?
- Mrs Hudson took my skull.

648
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:37,961
- So I'm basically filling in for your skull?
- Relax, you're doing fine.

649
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:39,761
- Well?
- Well, what?

650
00:47:39,841 --> 00:47:42,601
Well, you could just sit there
and watch telly.

651
00:47:42,681 --> 00:47:45,601
- You want me to come with you?
- I like company when I go out and...

652
00:47:45,681 --> 00:47:49,761
...I think better when I talk aloud.
The skull just attracts attention, so...

653
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:52,881
- Problem?
- Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.

654
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:58,041
- What about her?
- She said you get off on this, you enjoy it.

655
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:02,161
And I said "dangerous",
and here you are.

656
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,321
Damn it!

657
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:17,201
Where are we going?

658
00:48:17,281 --> 00:48:19,281
Northumberland Street's
a five-minute walk from here.

659
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:22,721
- You think he's stupid enough to go there?
- No, I think he's brilliant enough.

660
00:48:22,801 --> 00:48:26,001
I love the brilliant ones.
They're all so desperate to get caught.

661
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:28,001
- Why?
- Appreciation!

662
00:48:28,081 --> 00:48:32,321
Applause! At long last the spotlight.
That's the frailty of genius, John.

663
00:48:32,401 --> 00:48:34,561
- It needs an audience.
- Yeah.

664
00:48:34,641 --> 00:48:38,681
This is his hunting ground.
Right here in the heart of the city.

665
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:42,241
Now that we know his victims were abducted,
that changes everything.

666
00:48:42,321 --> 00:48:45,041
Because all of his victims
disappeared from busy streets...

667
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:47,361
...crowded places,
but nobody saw them go.

668
00:48:48,361 --> 00:48:51,441
Think! Who do we trust,
even though we don't know them?

669
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:54,921
Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

670
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:59,321
- Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?
- Don't know. Who?

671
00:48:59,401 --> 00:49:02,001
Haven't the faintest.
Hungry?

672
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,041
Thank you, Billy.

673
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:14,601
22 Northumberland Street.
Keep your eyes on it.

674
00:49:15,081 --> 00:49:18,041
He's not just going to ring the doorbell.
He'd need to be mad.

675
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,561
He has killed four people.

676
00:49:21,481 --> 00:49:22,081
OK.

677
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:25,201
Sherlock!

678
00:49:25,281 --> 00:49:27,761
Anything on the menu,
whatever you want, free.

679
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:30,081
On the house, for you
and for your date.

680
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:31,841
- Do you want to eat?
- I'm not his date.

681
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:34,881
- This man got me off a murder charge.
- This is Angelo.

682
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:36,881
Three years ago,
I proved to Lestrade...

683
00:49:36,961 --> 00:49:38,801
...at the time of a particularly
vicious triple murder...

684
00:49:38,881 --> 00:49:41,601
...that Angelo was in a different
part of town, house-breaking.

685
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:43,761
- He cleared my name.
- I cleared it a bit.

686
00:49:43,841 --> 00:49:46,161
- Anything happening opposite?
- Nothing.

687
00:49:46,241 --> 00:49:49,241
But for this man, I'd have gone to prison.
- You did go to prison.

688
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:51,921
I'll get a candle for the table.
It's more romantic.

689
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:53,841
I'm not his date!

690
00:49:55,641 --> 00:49:58,441
You may as well eat.
We might have a long wait.

691
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:00,921
Thanks.

692
00:50:08,241 --> 00:50:10,561
People don't have
arch-enemies.

693
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:13,961
- I'm sorry?
- In real life.

694
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:16,521
There are no arch-enemies
in real life. Doesn't happen.

695
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:18,881
Doesn't it?
Sounds a bit dull.

696
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:20,881
So who did I meet?

697
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:24,721
What do real people have, then,
in their... "real lives"?

698
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:27,041
Friends?

699
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:30,921
People they know, people they like,
people they don't like...

700
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:35,321
- Girlfriends, boyfriends.
- Yes, well, as I was saying, dull.

701
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:39,961
- You don't have a girlfriend, then?
- Girlfriend? No, not really my area.

702
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:43,961
Oh, right.

703
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:47,601
Do you have a boyfriend?
Which is fine, by the way.

704
00:50:47,681 --> 00:50:49,401
I know it's fine.

705
00:50:51,241 --> 00:50:52,801
- So you've got a boyfriend, then.
- No.

706
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:54,361
Right. OK.

707
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:58,721
You're unattached.
Like me.

708
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:01,601
Fine. Good.

709
00:51:09,961 --> 00:51:12,201
John, um...
I think you should know...

710
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:14,761
...I consider myself married to my work
and while I'm flattered...

711
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:20,081
- ...I'm really not looking for any...
- No, I'm... not asking. No.

712
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:23,841
I'm just saying,
it's all fine.

713
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:27,681
Good.

714
00:51:29,161 --> 00:51:30,361
Thank you.

715
00:51:32,681 --> 00:51:37,401
Look across the street. Taxi. It's stopped.
Nobody getting in and nobody getting out.

716
00:51:38,521 --> 00:51:39,681
Why a taxi?

717
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:44,401
- That's clever. Is it clever? Why is it clever?
- That's him.

718
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:46,561
- Don't stare.
- You're staring.

719
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:48,641
We can't both stare.

720
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:13,641
Sorry...

721
00:52:14,121 --> 00:52:16,401
- I've got the cab number.
- Good for you.

722
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:19,961
Right turn, one way, roadworks,
traffic lights, bus lane...

723
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:22,601
...pedestrian crossing, left turn only,
traffic lights.

724
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:29,001
- Oi!
- Sorry.

725
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:40,601
Come on, John...

726
00:52:59,561 --> 00:53:02,521
Come on, John.
We're losing him!

727
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,081
This way.

728
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:35,121
- No, this way!
- Sorry...

729
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:03,041
Police! Open her up.

730
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:08,161
No...

731
00:54:08,241 --> 00:54:10,401
Teeth, tan.
What, Californian?

732
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:14,041
LA, Santa Monica.
Just arrived.

733
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:17,081
- How could you possibly know that?
- The luggage.

734
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:19,481
First trip to London,
right?

735
00:54:20,121 --> 00:54:22,961
Going by your final destination
and the cabbie's route.

736
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:27,361
- Sorry, are you guys the police?
- Yeah. Everything all right?

737
00:54:28,521 --> 00:54:29,281
Yeah.

738
00:54:30,721 --> 00:54:32,521
Welcome to London.

739
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:37,161
Er, any problems,
just let us know.

740
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:42,521
Basically just a cab
that happened to slow down.

741
00:54:42,601 --> 00:54:44,201
- Basically.
- Not the murderer.

742
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,561
- Not the murderer, no.
- Wrong country, good alibi.

743
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:49,921
- As they go.
- Hey, where did you get this?

744
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,121
- Detective Inspector Lestrade?
- Yeah.

745
00:54:53,201 --> 00:54:55,001
I pickpocket him
when he's annoying.

746
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:58,361
You can keep that one,
I've got plenty at the flat.

747
00:55:00,441 --> 00:55:03,281
- What?
- Nothing, just... "Welcome to London."

748
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:09,881
- Got your breath back?
- Ready when you are.

749
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:20,801
That was ridiculous.

750
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:24,201
That was the most ridiculous thing
I've ever done.

751
00:55:24,281 --> 00:55:26,881
And you invaded Afghanistan.

752
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:32,001
That wasn't just me.
Why aren't we back at the restaurant?

753
00:55:32,081 --> 00:55:34,161
They can keep an eye out.

754
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:38,801
- It was a long shot anyway.
- So what were we doing there?

755
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:44,001
Oh, just passing the time.

756
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:45,801
And proving a point.

757
00:55:45,881 --> 00:55:47,041
- What point?
- You.

758
00:55:47,121 --> 00:55:51,201
Mrs Hudson! Dr Watson
will take the room upstairs.

759
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:54,801
- Says who?
- Says the man at the door.

760
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:06,361
Sherlock texted me.

761
00:56:07,521 --> 00:56:09,881
He said you forgot this.

762
00:56:13,401 --> 00:56:15,681
Er, thank you.
Thank you.

763
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:18,521
Sherlock,
what have you done?

764
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:20,881
- Mrs Hudson?
- Upstairs.

765
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:29,801
- What are you doing?
- I knew you'd find the case, I'm not stupid.

766
00:56:29,881 --> 00:56:32,521
- You can't just break into my flat.
- You can't withhold evidence.

767
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:35,361
- And I didn't break in.
- What do you call this, then?

768
00:56:36,321 --> 00:56:40,001
- It's a drugs bust.
- Seriously? This guy - a junkie?

769
00:56:40,081 --> 00:56:42,041
- Have you met him?
- John...

770
00:56:42,121 --> 00:56:44,001
You could search
this flat all day...

771
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:45,881
...you wouldn't find anything
you could call recreational.

772
00:56:45,961 --> 00:56:48,681
- John, you probably want to shut up now.
- But come on...

773
00:56:50,521 --> 00:56:52,081
- No...
- What?

774
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:53,801
- You?
- Shut up!

775
00:56:53,881 --> 00:56:57,041
- I'm not your sniffer dog.
- No, Anderson's my sniffer dog.

776
00:56:57,121 --> 00:56:57,601
What...?

777
00:56:58,721 --> 00:57:01,081
Anderson, what are you doing here
on a drugs bust?

778
00:57:01,161 --> 00:57:02,921
- Oh, I volunteered.
- They all did.

779
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:05,961
They're not strictly speaking
on the drug squad, but they're very keen.

780
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:08,121
- Are these human eyes?
- Put those back!

781
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:10,361
- They were in the microwave.
- It's an experiment.

782
00:57:10,441 --> 00:57:12,001
Keep looking, guys.

783
00:57:12,081 --> 00:57:14,041
Or you could help us properly,
and I'll stand them down.

784
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:16,401
- This is childish.
- Well, I'm dealing with a child.

785
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:20,481
Sherlock, this is our case. I'm letting you
in, but you do not go off on your own.

786
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:21,241
Clear?

787
00:57:21,321 --> 00:57:24,601
So you set up a pretend drugs bust
to bully me?

788
00:57:24,681 --> 00:57:27,921
- It stops being pretend if we find anything.
- I am clean!

789
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:32,241
- Is your flat? All of it?
- I don't even smoke.

790
00:57:32,641 --> 00:57:34,201
Neither do I.

791
00:57:36,321 --> 00:57:37,921
So let's work together.

792
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:40,601
- We've found Rachel.
- Who is she?

793
00:57:40,681 --> 00:57:44,241
- Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.
- Her daughter?

794
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:46,561
Why would she write
her daughter's name? Why?

795
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:48,681
Never mind that,
we found the case.

796
00:57:48,761 --> 00:57:51,361
According to someone,
the murderer has the case...

797
00:57:51,441 --> 00:57:54,001
...and we found it in the hands
of our favourite psychopath.

798
00:57:54,081 --> 00:57:56,481
Not a psychopath,
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

799
00:57:56,561 --> 00:57:57,641
Do your research.

800
00:57:57,721 --> 00:58:00,681
You need to bring Rachel in to
question her. I need to question her.

801
00:58:00,761 --> 00:58:02,241
- She's dead.
- Excellent. How, when and why?

802
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:03,641
Is there a connection?
There has to be.

803
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:06,041
Well, I doubt it,
since she's been dead for 14 years.

804
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:08,001
Technically,
she was never alive.

805
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:13,041
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's
stillborn daughter, 14 years ago.

806
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:14,561
Oh, that's...

807
00:58:15,321 --> 00:58:17,081
...that's not right.
How...

808
00:58:17,481 --> 00:58:19,281
Why would she do that?
Why?

809
00:58:19,361 --> 00:58:21,641
Why would she think of her daughter
in her last moments?

810
00:58:21,721 --> 00:58:25,361
- Yep, sociopath, I'm seeing it now.
- She didn't think about her daughter.

811
00:58:25,441 --> 00:58:28,641
She scratched her name on the floor
with her fingernails.

812
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:31,081
She was dying.
It took effort, it would have hurt.

813
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:34,401
You said that the victims
all took the poison themselves...

814
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:39,241
...that he makes them take it. Well,
maybe he, I don't know, talks to them.

815
00:58:39,321 --> 00:58:41,641
Maybe he used the death
of her daughter somehow.

816
00:58:41,721 --> 00:58:45,001
But that was ages ago.
Why would she still be upset?

817
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:51,241
- Not good?
- Bit not good, yeah.

818
00:58:51,321 --> 00:58:53,641
If you were dying,
if you'd been murdered...

819
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:55,561
...in your very last few seconds,
what would you say?

820
00:58:55,641 --> 00:58:58,481
- "Please, God, let me live."
- Use your imagination!

821
00:58:59,241 --> 00:59:00,041
I don't have to.

822
00:59:01,401 --> 00:59:03,161
Yeah, but if you were clever,
really clever.

823
00:59:03,241 --> 00:59:05,481
Jennifer Wilson running
all those lovers - she was clever.

824
00:59:05,561 --> 00:59:07,121
She's trying
to tell us something.

825
00:59:07,201 --> 00:59:09,481
Isn't the doorbell working?
Your taxi's here, Sherlock.

826
00:59:09,561 --> 00:59:13,321
- I didn't order a taxi. Go away.
- Oh, dear. They're making such a mess.

827
00:59:13,401 --> 00:59:16,161
- What are they looking for?
- It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.

828
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:19,121
But they're just for my hip.
They're herbal soothers...

829
00:59:19,201 --> 00:59:22,281
Shut up, everybody!
Don't move, don't speak, don't breathe!

830
00:59:22,361 --> 00:59:24,761
I'm trying to think. Anderson,
face the other way. You're putting me off.

831
00:59:24,841 --> 00:59:27,241
- What? My face is...
- Everybody quiet and still.

832
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:29,481
- Anderson, turn your back.
- Oh, for God's sake!

833
00:59:29,561 --> 00:59:31,041
Your back, now,
please!

834
00:59:31,121 --> 00:59:33,361
- Come on, think. Quick!
- What about your taxi?

835
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:34,601
Mrs Hudson!

836
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:38,601
Oh...

837
00:59:39,081 --> 00:59:40,441
Ah!

838
00:59:41,281 --> 00:59:44,721
She was clever.
Clever, yes!

839
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:49,201
She's cleverer than you lot and she's dead.
Do you see? Do you get it?

840
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:52,801
She didn't lose her phone,
she never lost it. She planted it on him.

841
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,681
When she got out of the car,
she knew that she was going to her death.

842
00:59:55,761 --> 00:59:58,961
She left the phone
in order to lead us to her killer.

843
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:01,761
- But how?
- What do you mean, how?

844
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:04,561
Rachel!

845
01:00:05,921 --> 01:00:07,441
Don't you see?
Rachel!

846
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:11,281
Oh...

847
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:13,201
Look at you lot.
You're all so vacant.

848
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:15,521
Is it nice not being me?
It must be so relaxing.

849
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:18,001
- Rachel is not a name.
- Then what is it?

850
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,601
John, on the luggage, there's a label.
E-mail address.

851
01:00:23,441 --> 01:00:26,921
Er, jenny.pink@mephone.org.uk.

852
01:00:27,001 --> 01:00:30,161
She didn't have a laptop, which means
she did her business on her phone.

853
01:00:30,241 --> 01:00:33,761
So it's a smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.
So there was a website for her account.

854
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:37,041
The username is her e-mail address,
and all together now, the password is...?

855
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:40,161
- Rachel.
- So we can read her e-mails. So what?

856
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:43,001
Anderson, don't talk out loud.
You lower the IQ of the whole street.

857
01:00:43,081 --> 01:00:46,761
We can do much more than that.
It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.

858
01:00:46,841 --> 01:00:48,681
Which means if you lose it,
you can locate it online.

859
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:50,961
She's leading us
to the man who killed her.

860
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,401
- Unless he got rid of it.
- We know he didn't.

861
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:57,281
- Come on, come on. Quickly!
- Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver...

862
01:00:57,361 --> 01:01:00,281
Mrs Hudson, isn't it time
for your evening soother?

863
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:04,601
Get vehicles, get a helicopter.
This phone battery won't last for ever.

864
01:01:04,681 --> 01:01:07,481
- We'll just have a map reference, not a name.
- It's a start!

865
01:01:07,561 --> 01:01:08,401
Sherlock...

866
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:11,641
Narrows it down from just anyone in London.
It's the first proper lead we've had.

867
01:01:11,721 --> 01:01:14,841
- Sherlock...
- Where is it? Quickly, where?

868
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,001
Here.
It's... in 221 Baker Street.

869
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:21,761
How can it be here?

870
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:23,041
How?

871
01:01:23,121 --> 01:01:25,681
Maybe it was in the case
when you brought it back.

872
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:28,881
- And it fell out somewhere.
- And I didn't notice it?

873
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:32,121
- I didn't notice?
- Anyway, we texted him, and he called back.

874
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:35,721
Guys, we're also looking for a mobile
somewhere here, belonged to the victim.

875
01:01:35,801 --> 01:01:38,321
Who do we trust,
even if we don't know them?

876
01:01:48,241 --> 01:01:51,641
Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

877
01:01:55,361 --> 01:01:58,601
Who hunts in the middle
of a crowd?

878
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:38,601
- Sherlock, are you OK?
- What?

879
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:41,281
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

880
01:02:41,361 --> 01:02:44,441
- So, how can the phone be here?
- Don't know.

881
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:46,641
- I'll try it again.
- Good idea.

882
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,961
Where are you going?

883
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:51,721
Fresh air, just popping outside
for a moment. Won't be long.

884
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,561
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

885
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,761
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

886
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:11,201
I didn't order a taxi.

887
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:13,361
Doesn't mean
you don't need one.

888
01:03:14,401 --> 01:03:16,201
You're the cabbie.

889
01:03:17,521 --> 01:03:20,761
The one who stopped outside
Northumberland Street.

890
01:03:24,441 --> 01:03:27,321
It was you.
Not your passenger.

891
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:30,601
See? No-one ever thinks
about the cabbie.

892
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:32,601
It's like you're invisible.

893
01:03:32,681 --> 01:03:34,761
Just the back of an 'ead.

894
01:03:35,441 --> 01:03:38,041
Proper advantage
for a serial killer.

895
01:03:40,521 --> 01:03:43,281
- Is this a confession?
- Oh, yeah.

896
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:45,521
I'll tell you what else...

897
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:48,681
If you call the coppers now,
I won't run.

898
01:03:48,761 --> 01:03:52,041
I'll sit quiet, and they can
take me down, I promise.

899
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:53,681
Why?

900
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:56,761
- Cos you're not going to do that.
- Am I not?

901
01:03:58,481 --> 01:04:01,601
I didn't kill those four people,
Mr Holmes.

902
01:04:01,681 --> 01:04:03,281
I spoke to 'em...

903
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:06,321
...and they killed themselves.

904
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:11,161
If you get the coppers now,
I'll promise you one thing.

905
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,281
I will never tell you
what I said.

906
01:04:20,001 --> 01:04:23,641
No-one else will die, though,
and I believe they call that a result.

907
01:04:23,721 --> 01:04:27,361
And you won't ever understand
how those people died.

908
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:31,001
What kind of result
do you care about?

909
01:04:46,161 --> 01:04:48,641
If I wanted to understand...

910
01:04:49,801 --> 01:04:52,121
- ...what would I do?
- Let me take you for a ride.

911
01:04:52,201 --> 01:04:56,521
- So you can kill me too?
- I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes.

912
01:04:57,481 --> 01:04:59,721
I'm going to talk to you...

913
01:05:00,801 --> 01:05:03,121
...and then you're going
to kill yourself.

914
01:05:20,961 --> 01:05:24,441
He just got in a cab.
It's Sherlock. He just drove off in a cab.

915
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:27,841
I told you, he does that.
He bloody left again.

916
01:05:27,921 --> 01:05:29,401
We're wasting our time!

917
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:32,841
I'm calling the phone,
it's ringing out.

918
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:45,561
And if it's ringing,
it's not here.

919
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:49,321
- I'll try the search again.
- Does it matter? Does any of it?

920
01:05:49,401 --> 01:05:51,801
He's just a lunatic
and he'll always let you down.

921
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:55,281
And you're wasting your time.
All our time.

922
01:06:01,881 --> 01:06:03,441
OK, everybody...

923
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:05,361
Done here.

924
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:09,401
How did you find me?

925
01:06:09,481 --> 01:06:11,481
Oh, I recognised you.

926
01:06:13,121 --> 01:06:14,841
Soon as I saw
you chasing my cab.

927
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:17,921
Sherlock Holmes!

928
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,401
I was warned about you.

929
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:25,281
I've been on your website too.
Brilliant stuff! Loved it.

930
01:06:26,121 --> 01:06:29,961
- Who warned you about me?
- Just someone out there who's noticed.

931
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:32,441
Who?

932
01:06:39,441 --> 01:06:40,961
Who would notice me?

933
01:06:41,481 --> 01:06:44,121
- You're too modest, Mr Holmes.
- I'm really not.

934
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,441
Got yourself a fan.

935
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:50,841
- Tell me more.
- That's all you're going to know.

936
01:06:52,401 --> 01:06:54,241
In this lifetime.

937
01:06:55,001 --> 01:06:57,441
Why did he do that?
Why did he have to leave?

938
01:06:58,361 --> 01:06:59,761
You know him better
than I do.

939
01:07:00,241 --> 01:07:03,041
I've known him for five years
and, no, I don't.

940
01:07:04,841 --> 01:07:09,161
- So why do you put up with him?
- Because I'm desperate, that's why.

941
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:13,761
And because Sherlock Holmes
is a great man.

942
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:19,801
And I think one day, if we're very, very
lucky, he might even be a good one.

943
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:42,281
Where are we?

944
01:07:43,281 --> 01:07:46,481
You know every street in London.
You know exactly where we are.

945
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:49,721
Roland-Kerr
Further Education College.

946
01:07:49,801 --> 01:07:51,961
- Why here?
- It's open.

947
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:55,841
Cleaners are in...
One thing about being a cabbie...

948
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:58,601
...you always know
a nice quiet spot for a murder.

949
01:07:58,681 --> 01:08:01,641
I'm surprised more of us
don't branch out.

950
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:04,641
And you just walk
your victims in? How?

951
01:08:06,201 --> 01:08:08,241
Oh... Dull.

952
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:10,561
Don't worry.
It gets better.

953
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:13,721
You can't make people
take their own lives at gunpoint.

954
01:08:13,801 --> 01:08:15,201
I don't.

955
01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:17,561
It's much better than that.

956
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:21,601
Don't need this with you.
Cos you'll follow me.

957
01:09:13,401 --> 01:09:15,001
Well,
what do you think?

958
01:09:16,481 --> 01:09:18,201
It's up to you.

959
01:09:18,281 --> 01:09:20,041
You're the one
who's going to die here.

960
01:09:22,281 --> 01:09:25,001
- No, I'm not.
- That's what they all say.

961
01:09:27,281 --> 01:09:28,961
Shall we talk?

962
01:09:43,521 --> 01:09:45,521
Bit risky, wasn't it?

963
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:49,001
Took me away under the eye
of about half a dozen policemen.

964
01:09:49,081 --> 01:09:51,481
They're not that stupid.

965
01:09:51,561 --> 01:09:56,521
- And Mrs Hudson will remember you.
- You call that a risk? Nah...

966
01:09:56,601 --> 01:09:58,641
This is a risk.

967
01:10:06,401 --> 01:10:08,321
Oh, I like this bit.

968
01:10:08,961 --> 01:10:10,801
Cos you don't get it yet,
do ya?

969
01:10:12,801 --> 01:10:14,801
But you're about to.

970
01:10:15,641 --> 01:10:17,921
I just have to do this...

971
01:10:23,561 --> 01:10:26,281
Weren't expecting that,
were ya?

972
01:10:26,361 --> 01:10:28,961
- Oh, you're gonna love this.
- Love what?

973
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:31,721
Sherlock Holmes,
look at you!

974
01:10:33,081 --> 01:10:34,361
Here in the flesh.

975
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:38,201
That website of yours,
your fan told me about it.

976
01:10:38,721 --> 01:10:39,881
My fan?

977
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,081
You are brilliant.

978
01:10:42,561 --> 01:10:44,961
You are a proper genius.

979
01:10:45,601 --> 01:10:48,801
The Science Of Deduction.
Now, that...

980
01:10:48,881 --> 01:10:51,001
...is proper thinking.

981
01:10:52,441 --> 01:10:55,201
Between you and me sitting here,
why can't people think?

982
01:10:56,681 --> 01:10:58,841
Don't it make you mad?

983
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:02,641
Why can't people just think?

984
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:10,321
Oh, I see...
So you're a proper genius too.

985
01:11:10,801 --> 01:11:12,721
Don't look it, do I?

986
01:11:13,521 --> 01:11:15,561
Funny little man
driving a cab.

987
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:18,801
But you'll know better
in a minute.

988
01:11:18,881 --> 01:11:22,001
Chances are it'll be
the last thing you ever know.

989
01:11:24,161 --> 01:11:26,361
OK, two bottles.
Explain.

990
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:29,481
There's a good bottle
and a bad bottle.

991
01:11:29,561 --> 01:11:32,081
You take the pill
from the good bottle, you live.

992
01:11:32,681 --> 01:11:36,201
You take the pill
from the bad bottle, you die.

993
01:11:36,281 --> 01:11:38,841
- Both bottles are of course identical.
- In every way.

994
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:40,921
- And you know which is which.
- Of course I know.

995
01:11:41,001 --> 01:11:43,241
- But I don't.
- Wouldn't be a game if you knew.

996
01:11:43,321 --> 01:11:47,521
- You're the one who chooses.
- Why should I? I've got nothing to go on.

997
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:52,001
- What's in it for me?
- I haven't told you the best bit yet.

998
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:56,361
Whatever bottle you choose,
I take the pill from the other one.

999
01:11:57,121 --> 01:11:58,841
And then together...

1000
01:11:59,561 --> 01:12:01,361
...we take our medicine.

1001
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:06,241
I won't cheat.
It's your choice.

1002
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:09,761
I'll take whatever pill
you don't.

1003
01:12:12,641 --> 01:12:15,081
Didn't expect that, did you,
Mr Holmes?

1004
01:12:15,521 --> 01:12:18,481
This is what you did to the rest of them,
you gave them a choice?

1005
01:12:18,561 --> 01:12:20,081
And now
I'm giving you one.

1006
01:12:21,761 --> 01:12:23,521
You take your time.

1007
01:12:23,601 --> 01:12:25,641
Get yourself together.

1008
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:29,281
- I want your best game.
- It's not a game, it's chance.

1009
01:12:29,361 --> 01:12:32,441
I've played four times.
I'm alive.

1010
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:36,681
It's not chance, Mr Holmes,
it's chess.

1011
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:40,281
It's a game of chess,
with one move...

1012
01:12:41,561 --> 01:12:43,401
...and one survivor.

1013
01:12:44,641 --> 01:12:46,361
And this, this...

1014
01:12:47,241 --> 01:12:48,961
...is the move.

1015
01:12:57,201 --> 01:13:00,601
Did I just give you the good bottle
or the bad bottle?

1016
01:13:00,681 --> 01:13:02,841
You can choose either one.

1017
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:08,801
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade,
I need to speak to him.

1018
01:13:08,881 --> 01:13:11,081
It's important.
It's an emergency.

1019
01:13:11,561 --> 01:13:13,361
Er, left here, please.
Left here...

1020
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:27,521
You ready yet,
Mr Holmes?

1021
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:31,201
- Ready to play?
- Play what? It's a 50:50 chance.

1022
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:33,881
You're not playing the numbers,
you're playing me.

1023
01:13:36,521 --> 01:13:38,961
Did I just give you the good pill
or the bad pill?

1024
01:13:39,441 --> 01:13:41,081
Is it a bluff...

1025
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:43,121
...or a double bluff?

1026
01:13:43,561 --> 01:13:45,281
- Or a triple bluff?
- It's still just chance.

1027
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:47,161
Four people, in a row?
It's not chance.

1028
01:13:47,241 --> 01:13:49,001
- Luck.
- It's genius!

1029
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:55,161
I know how people think.
I know how people think I think.

1030
01:13:56,081 --> 01:13:58,601
I can see it all
like a map inside my head.

1031
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:02,401
Everyone's so stupid,
even you.

1032
01:14:02,881 --> 01:14:04,561
Or maybe
God just loves me.

1033
01:14:08,081 --> 01:14:11,441
Either way,
you're wasted as a cabbie.

1034
01:14:19,401 --> 01:14:21,041
So...

1035
01:14:22,081 --> 01:14:26,041
...you risked your life four times
just to kill strangers. Why?

1036
01:14:26,761 --> 01:14:29,841
- Time to play.
- Oh, I am playing.

1037
01:14:30,401 --> 01:14:31,441
This is my turn.

1038
01:14:32,521 --> 01:14:36,841
There's shaving foam behind your left ear.
Nobody's pointed it out to you.

1039
01:14:36,921 --> 01:14:39,561
Traces of where it's happened before,
so obviously you live on your own.

1040
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,041
There's no-one
to tell you.

1041
01:14:41,121 --> 01:14:44,281
But there's a photograph of children.
The children's mother's been cut out.

1042
01:14:44,361 --> 01:14:48,041
If she'd died, she'd still be there.
The photograph's old, but the frame's new.

1043
01:14:48,121 --> 01:14:50,681
You think of your children,
but you don't get to see them.

1044
01:14:50,761 --> 01:14:52,521
Estranged father.

1045
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:56,041
She took the kids,
but you still love them.

1046
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:58,041
And it still hurts.

1047
01:14:59,681 --> 01:15:00,681
Ah, but there's more.

1048
01:15:02,521 --> 01:15:04,561
Your clothes.
Recently laundered...

1049
01:15:04,641 --> 01:15:07,401
...but everything you're wearing
is at least three years old?

1050
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:11,961
Keeping up appearances,
but not planning ahead.

1051
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:16,281
And here you are on a kamikaze
murder spree. What's that about?

1052
01:15:20,481 --> 01:15:21,961
Ah...

1053
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:24,801
Three years ago.
Is that when they told you?

1054
01:15:24,881 --> 01:15:26,321
Told me what?

1055
01:15:27,001 --> 01:15:29,281
- That you're a dead man walking.
- So are you.

1056
01:15:29,361 --> 01:15:31,881
You don't have long, though.
Am I right?

1057
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:36,681
Aneurism.
Right in 'ere.

1058
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:42,201
Any breath
could be my last.

1059
01:15:42,601 --> 01:15:45,281
And because you're dying,
you've just murdered four people.

1060
01:15:45,361 --> 01:15:47,881
I've outlived four people.

1061
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:52,081
That's the most fun you can have
with an aneurism.

1062
01:15:52,921 --> 01:15:54,361
No...

1063
01:15:54,441 --> 01:15:56,641
No, there's something else.

1064
01:15:56,721 --> 01:16:01,121
You didn't just kill four people because
you're bitter. Bitterness is a paralytic.

1065
01:16:01,201 --> 01:16:04,721
Love is a much more
vicious motivator.

1066
01:16:06,561 --> 01:16:09,801
Somehow,
this is about your children.

1067
01:16:12,761 --> 01:16:15,281
- You are good, in't ya?
- But how?

1068
01:16:16,681 --> 01:16:20,041
When I die,
they won't get much, my kids.

1069
01:16:21,881 --> 01:16:23,761
Not a lot of money
in driving cabs.

1070
01:16:23,841 --> 01:16:26,201
- Or serial killing.
- You'd be surprised.

1071
01:16:26,801 --> 01:16:27,841
Surprise me.

1072
01:16:30,361 --> 01:16:33,561
- I have a sponsor.
- You have a what?

1073
01:16:33,641 --> 01:16:36,841
For every life I take,
money goes to my kids.

1074
01:16:37,161 --> 01:16:40,841
The more I kill...
the better off they'll be.

1075
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:46,361
- You see? It's nicer than you think.
- Who'd sponsor a serial killer?

1076
01:16:46,441 --> 01:16:49,601
Who'd be a fan
of Sherlock Holmes?

1077
01:16:52,921 --> 01:16:55,401
You're not the only one
to enjoy a good murder.

1078
01:16:56,041 --> 01:17:00,281
There's others out there just like you,
except you're just a man.

1079
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:03,801
And they're so
much more than that.

1080
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,761
What do you mean...

1081
01:17:06,841 --> 01:17:08,841
...more than a man?

1082
01:17:10,201 --> 01:17:11,881
An organisation... what?

1083
01:17:12,321 --> 01:17:15,281
There's a name
that no-one says.

1084
01:17:16,121 --> 01:17:17,921
And I'm not going
to say it either.

1085
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:21,721
Now, enough chatter.

1086
01:17:24,001 --> 01:17:25,481
Time to choose.

1087
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:31,321
Sherlock!

1088
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:37,601
Sherlock!

1089
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:41,361
What if I don't choose either?
I could just walk out of here.

1090
01:17:45,041 --> 01:17:47,321
You can take
a 50:50 chance...

1091
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:50,841
...or I can shoot you
in the head.

1092
01:17:51,761 --> 01:17:55,281
Funnily enough,
no-one's ever gone for that option.

1093
01:17:55,841 --> 01:17:57,401
I'll have the gun,
please.

1094
01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:00,041
Are you sure?

1095
01:18:01,161 --> 01:18:03,761
Definitely... The gun.

1096
01:18:04,241 --> 01:18:05,881
You don't want
to phone a friend?

1097
01:18:06,961 --> 01:18:08,441
The gun.

1098
01:18:14,201 --> 01:18:15,921
I know a real gun
when I see one.

1099
01:18:17,721 --> 01:18:20,521
- None of the others did.
- Clearly.

1100
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:24,521
Well, this has been
very interesting.

1101
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:27,641
I look forward
to the court case.

1102
01:18:30,761 --> 01:18:32,881
Just before you go,
did you figure it out?

1103
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:38,641
- Which one's the good bottle?
- Course. Child's play.

1104
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:40,921
Well, which one, then?

1105
01:18:42,601 --> 01:18:43,801
Which one
would you have picked?

1106
01:18:43,881 --> 01:18:46,961
Just so I know whether
I could have beaten you.

1107
01:18:48,161 --> 01:18:49,521
Come on!

1108
01:18:50,081 --> 01:18:51,761
Play the game.

1109
01:19:05,761 --> 01:19:06,801
Oh!

1110
01:19:07,801 --> 01:19:09,361
Interesting.

1111
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:20,081
So what do you think?

1112
01:19:21,121 --> 01:19:22,521
Shall we?

1113
01:19:25,001 --> 01:19:27,361
Really...
what do you think?

1114
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:30,761
Can you beat me?

1115
01:19:33,241 --> 01:19:35,201
Are you clever enough...

1116
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:37,881
...to bet your life?

1117
01:19:49,721 --> 01:19:51,201
Sherlock!

1118
01:19:53,601 --> 01:19:55,521
I bet you get bored,
don't you?

1119
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:58,441
I know you do.

1120
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,081
A man like you.

1121
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:02,601
So clever.

1122
01:20:03,521 --> 01:20:07,601
But what's the point of being clever
if you can't prove it?

1123
01:20:08,641 --> 01:20:10,401
Still the addict.

1124
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:13,001
But this...

1125
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:15,761
...this is what
you're really addicted to.

1126
01:20:17,801 --> 01:20:19,081
You'll do anything...

1127
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:24,321
...anything at all,
to stop being bored.

1128
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:28,921
You're not bored now,
are ya?

1129
01:20:29,961 --> 01:20:30,881
Isn't it good?

1130
01:20:45,801 --> 01:20:48,081
Was I right?
I was, wasn't I?

1131
01:20:49,001 --> 01:20:50,361
Did I get it right?

1132
01:20:54,521 --> 01:20:55,921
OK.

1133
01:20:56,001 --> 01:20:57,521
Tell me this.

1134
01:20:58,481 --> 01:21:00,881
Your sponsor.
Who was it?

1135
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:02,961
The one who told you
about me, my fan.

1136
01:21:03,481 --> 01:21:04,841
I want a name.

1137
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:06,361
No...

1138
01:21:06,921 --> 01:21:09,681
You're dying,
but there's still time to hurt you.

1139
01:21:09,761 --> 01:21:11,601
Give me a name.

1140
01:21:15,201 --> 01:21:16,001
A name!

1141
01:21:16,721 --> 01:21:17,681
Now!

1142
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:20,881
The name!

1143
01:21:21,681 --> 01:21:24,081
Moriarty!

1144
01:21:46,561 --> 01:21:49,041
Why have I got this blanket?
They keep putting this blanket on me.

1145
01:21:49,121 --> 01:21:50,881
- Yeah, it's for shock.
- I'm not in shock.

1146
01:21:50,961 --> 01:21:53,641
Yeah, but some of the guys
want to take photographs.

1147
01:21:55,641 --> 01:21:59,001
- So, the shooter - no sign?
- Cleared off before we got here.

1148
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,161
But a guy like that
would have had enemies, I suppose.

1149
01:22:01,241 --> 01:22:05,601
One of them could have been following him,
but... we've got nothing to go on.

1150
01:22:06,241 --> 01:22:08,001
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1151
01:22:09,761 --> 01:22:11,121
OK. Give me.

1152
01:22:11,721 --> 01:22:14,201
The bullet they just dug out
of the wall's from a handgun.

1153
01:22:14,281 --> 01:22:16,241
A kill shot over that distance,
from that kind of a weapon...

1154
01:22:16,321 --> 01:22:18,961
...that's a crack shot.
But not just a marksman, a fighter.

1155
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:22,321
His hands couldn't have shaken at all,
so clearly he's acclimatised to violence.

1156
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:26,201
He didn't fire until I was in immediate
danger, though, so strong moral principle.

1157
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:30,641
You're looking for a man probably
with a history of military service and...

1158
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:31,641
...nerves of steel.

1159
01:22:38,361 --> 01:22:39,961
Actually, do you know what?
Ignore me.

1160
01:22:40,041 --> 01:22:41,321
- Sorry?
- Ignore all of that.

1161
01:22:41,401 --> 01:22:44,241
It's just the, er...
the shock talking.

1162
01:22:44,321 --> 01:22:46,881
- Where are you going?
- I just need to talk about the rent.

1163
01:22:46,961 --> 01:22:48,721
- I've still got questions.
- What now?

1164
01:22:48,801 --> 01:22:50,561
I'm in shock.
Look, I've got a blanket.

1165
01:22:50,641 --> 01:22:51,841
- Sherlock!
- And...

1166
01:22:51,921 --> 01:22:54,561
I just caught you
a serial killer.

1167
01:22:55,081 --> 01:22:55,881
More or less.

1168
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:02,321
OK. We'll pull you in tomorrow.
Off you go.

1169
01:23:09,361 --> 01:23:14,161
Erm... Sergeant Donovan's just been
explaining everything. Two pills...

1170
01:23:16,121 --> 01:23:18,241
Dreadful business, isn't it?
Dreadful.

1171
01:23:19,521 --> 01:23:20,441
Good shot.

1172
01:23:21,481 --> 01:23:23,681
Yes. Yes, must have been.
Through that window.

1173
01:23:23,761 --> 01:23:24,721
Well, you'd know.

1174
01:23:27,401 --> 01:23:29,041
Need to get the powder burns
out of your fingers.

1175
01:23:29,121 --> 01:23:32,801
I don't suppose you'd serve time for this,
but let's avoid the court case.

1176
01:23:33,881 --> 01:23:35,801
- Are you all right?
- Yes, of course I'm all right.

1177
01:23:35,881 --> 01:23:37,761
- You have just killed a man.
- Yes, I...

1178
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:42,801
That's true, isn't it?

1179
01:23:44,521 --> 01:23:46,121
But he wasn't
a very nice man.

1180
01:23:47,761 --> 01:23:51,761
- No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?
- Frankly, a bloody awful cabbie.

1181
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,761
That's true,
he was a bad cabbie.

1182
01:23:54,841 --> 01:23:57,281
You should have seen the route
he took us to get here.

1183
01:23:57,361 --> 01:23:59,921
Stop! We can't giggle,
it's a crime scene. Stop it.

1184
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:02,441
- You're the one who shot him.
- Keep your voice down!

1185
01:24:02,521 --> 01:24:05,121
- Sorry, it's just, erm... nerves, I think.
- Sorry.

1186
01:24:06,721 --> 01:24:08,561
You were going to take that damn pill,
weren't you?

1187
01:24:08,641 --> 01:24:10,361
Course I wasn't.

1188
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,281
Biding my time.
Knew you'd turn up.

1189
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:15,321
No, you didn't.

1190
01:24:15,761 --> 01:24:18,521
That's how you get your kicks, isn't it?
You risk your life to prove you're clever.

1191
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:21,801
- Why would I do that?
- Because you're an idiot.

1192
01:24:23,481 --> 01:24:25,401
- Dinner?
- Starving.

1193
01:24:26,081 --> 01:24:28,561
End of Baker Street, there's a
good Chinese. Stays open till two.

1194
01:24:28,641 --> 01:24:31,321
You can tell a good Chinese
by the bottom third of the door handle.

1195
01:24:31,401 --> 01:24:34,921
Sherlock. That's him, that's the man
I was talking to you about.

1196
01:24:35,001 --> 01:24:37,641
I know exactly
who that is.

1197
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:40,241
So, another case cracked.

1198
01:24:40,561 --> 01:24:42,721
How very public-spirited.

1199
01:24:42,801 --> 01:24:45,161
Though that's never really
your motivation, is it?

1200
01:24:45,921 --> 01:24:49,321
- What are you doing here?
- As ever, I'm concerned about you.

1201
01:24:49,401 --> 01:24:51,761
Yes, I've been hearing
about your "concern".

1202
01:24:51,841 --> 01:24:53,481
Always so aggressive.

1203
01:24:53,561 --> 01:24:56,401
Did it never occur to you that
you and I belong on the same side?

1204
01:24:56,801 --> 01:24:58,481
Oddly enough... no.

1205
01:24:58,561 --> 01:25:01,561
We have more in common
than you'd like to believe.

1206
01:25:01,641 --> 01:25:05,681
This petty feud between us
is simply childish. People will suffer.

1207
01:25:06,361 --> 01:25:08,481
And you know
how it always upset Mummy.

1208
01:25:09,681 --> 01:25:11,281
I upset her?

1209
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:12,281
Me?

1210
01:25:13,561 --> 01:25:17,601
- It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.
- No. No, wait...

1211
01:25:17,681 --> 01:25:20,761
- Mummy? Who's Mummy?
- Mother. Our mother.

1212
01:25:20,841 --> 01:25:22,841
This is my brother,
Mycroft.

1213
01:25:23,601 --> 01:25:24,801
Putting on weight again?

1214
01:25:25,641 --> 01:25:27,121
Losing it, in fact.

1215
01:25:27,481 --> 01:25:30,281
- He's your brother?
- Course he's my brother.

1216
01:25:31,201 --> 01:25:32,681
- So he's not...
- Not what?

1217
01:25:34,241 --> 01:25:37,321
I don't know...
criminal mastermind?

1218
01:25:38,121 --> 01:25:40,241
- Close enough.
- For goodness' sake.

1219
01:25:40,321 --> 01:25:42,761
I occupy a minor position
in the British Government.

1220
01:25:42,841 --> 01:25:45,921
He is the British Government, when he's not
too busy being the British Secret Service...

1221
01:25:46,001 --> 01:25:48,681
...or the CIA
on a freelance basis.

1222
01:25:48,761 --> 01:25:52,161
Good evening, Mycroft.
Try not to start a war before I get home.

1223
01:25:52,241 --> 01:25:54,001
You know what it does
for the traffic.

1224
01:25:56,961 --> 01:26:00,681
So, when you say you're concerned
about him, you actually are concerned?

1225
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:02,321
Yes, of course.

1226
01:26:02,841 --> 01:26:04,921
It actually is
a childish feud?

1227
01:26:05,601 --> 01:26:07,881
He's always been
so resentful.

1228
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:09,801
You can imagine
the Christmas dinners.

1229
01:26:10,321 --> 01:26:12,921
Yeah...
No... God, no.

1230
01:26:14,441 --> 01:26:17,481
I'd better, erm...
Hello again.

1231
01:26:19,001 --> 01:26:21,881
- Hello.
- We met earlier on this evening.

1232
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:24,921
- Oh!
- OK. Good night.

1233
01:26:25,001 --> 01:26:26,601
Good night, Dr Watson.

1234
01:26:28,681 --> 01:26:30,121
So, dim sum.

1235
01:26:30,201 --> 01:26:32,441
- I can always predict the fortune cookies.
- No, you can't.

1236
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:34,681
Almost can.
You did get shot, though.

1237
01:26:34,761 --> 01:26:35,721
- Sorry?
- In Afghanistan.

1238
01:26:35,801 --> 01:26:38,201
- There was an actual wound.
- Oh. Yeah, shoulder.

1239
01:26:38,281 --> 01:26:40,001
- Shoulder! I thought so.
- No, you didn't.

1240
01:26:40,081 --> 01:26:41,481
- The left one.
- Lucky guess.

1241
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:44,321
- I never guess.
- Yes, you do.

1242
01:26:44,401 --> 01:26:46,881
- What are you so happy about?
- Moriarty.

1243
01:26:46,961 --> 01:26:50,841
- What's Moriarty?
- I've absolutely no idea.

1244
01:26:51,921 --> 01:26:53,641
Sir, shall we go?

1245
01:26:54,441 --> 01:26:56,201
Interesting,
that soldier fellow.

1246
01:26:57,201 --> 01:27:00,041
He could be
the making of my brother...

1247
01:27:00,121 --> 01:27:02,321
...or make him worse
than ever.

1248
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:05,641
Either way, we'd better upgrade
their surveillance status.

1249
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:08,081
Grade 3 active.

1250
01:27:08,161 --> 01:27:10,121
Sorry, sir.
Whose status?

1251
01:27:12,161 --> 01:27:15,481
Sherlock Holmes
and Dr Watson.
