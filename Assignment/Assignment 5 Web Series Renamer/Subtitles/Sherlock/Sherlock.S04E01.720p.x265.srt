1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,554
- My brother is a murderer.

2
00:00:02,579 --> 00:00:05,572
No chance for you to be a
hero this time, Mr Holmes.

3
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:06,972
Oh, do your research.

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:11,372
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

5
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:13,452
Merry Christmas!

6
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:17,932
I'm not given to outbursts
of brotherly compassion.

7
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:20,093
You know what happened to the other one.

8
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:26,132
Miss me?

9
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:28,532
'Did you miss me? Did you
miss me? Did you miss me?'

10
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,372
I've only been gone four minutes.

11
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:32,493
Well, I certainly hope
you've learnt your lesson.

12
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:36,972
What you're about to see is

13
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:39,252
classified beyond top secret.

14
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:43,852
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.

15
00:00:43,853 --> 00:00:46,813
Once beyond these walls,
you must never speak of it.

16
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:50,572
A D notice has been slapped
on the entire incident.

17
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:52,372
Only those within this room,

18
00:00:52,373 --> 00:00:56,212
code names Antarctica,
Langdale, Porlock and Love,

19
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:58,612
will ever know the whole truth.

20
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:00,492
As far as everyone else is concerned,

21
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,212
going to the Prime Minister

22
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:04,772
and way beyond, Charles Augustus...

23
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,932
- Are you tweeting?!
- No.

24
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,909
- Well, that's what it looks like!
- Of course I'm not tweeting.

25
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,010
Why would I be tweeting?

26
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:11,132
- Give me that!
- What? No!

27
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:12,249
What are you doing?!

28
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:13,557
- Get off!
- Give it here!

29
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:17,212
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.

30
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:19,492
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.

31
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:21,173
Will you take this matter
seriously, Sherlock?

32
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:23,772
I am taking it seriously! What makes
you think I'm not taking it seriously?

33
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:25,932
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"

34
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:28,572
Look, not so long ago I was on a
mission that meant certain death -

35
00:01:28,573 --> 00:01:29,289
my death!

36
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:32,372
And now I'm back, in a nice warm
office, with my big brother and...

37
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:33,692
Are those ginger nuts?

38
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,692
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.

39
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:37,572
Our doctor said you were clean.

40
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:39,292
I am. Utterly.

41
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:42,492
No need for stimulants now,
remember? I have work to do.

42
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:43,892
You're high as a kite!

43
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:46,612
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.

44
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:49,252
I'm just.....glad to be alive!

45
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:51,812
What shall we do next? What's your name?

46
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:53,052
Vivian.

47
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:55,492
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?

48
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:58,212
Well, it's a lovely day. Go for a stroll?

49
00:01:58,213 --> 00:02:01,052
Make a paper aeroplane? Have an ice lolly?

50
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:02,572
Ice lolly, I suppose.

51
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:04,412
Ice lolly it is!

52
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:07,052
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...

53
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:10,172
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?

54
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,053
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?

55
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:16,692
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.

56
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:21,892
'Do your research.

57
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:25,452
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

58
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,772
..sociopath.

59
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,332
..sociopath.'

60
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,812
I see. Who is supposed to have
shot him, then?

61
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:37,452
Some over-eager squaddie with an
itchy trigger finger - that's who.

62
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:40,852
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.

63
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:43,132
Remarkable. How did you do it?

64
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:46,172
We have some very talented
people working here.

65
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:49,092
If James Moriarty can hack
every TV screen in the land,

66
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:53,013
rest assured we have the tech to
doctor a bit of security footage.

67
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:56,732
That is now the official version,

68
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:59,332
the version anyone we want to will see.

69
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,092
No need to go to the trouble of getting

70
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:03,132
some sort of official pardon.

71
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:06,052
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.

72
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,892
You're home and dry.

73
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:09,092
OK, cheers.

74
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:11,652
Obviously, there's unfinished business.

75
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:12,892
Moriarty.

76
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,692
I told you - Moriarty's dead.

77
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:17,692
You say he filmed that video
message before he died.

78
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:19,092
Yes.

79
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:22,972
You also say you know what
he's going to do next.

80
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:26,012
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.

81
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:27,852
Perhaps he was just
trying to frighten you.

82
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:30,333
No, no, he would never
be that disappointing.

83
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:33,612
He's planned something,
something long-term.

84
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,732
Something that would take
effect if he never made it

85
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,532
off that rooftop alive.

86
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,972
Posthumous revenge.

87
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:42,332
No, better than that - posthumous game.

88
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,172
We brought you back to deal with this.

89
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:46,612
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.

90
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:48,052
Wait?!

91
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:50,932
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.

92
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:54,412
Look, whatever's coming,
whatever he's lined up,

93
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:55,732
I'll know when it begins.

94
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,332
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?

95
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,892
Why?

96
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:01,213
Because I love it.

97
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,612
There was once a merchant,
in the famous market at Baghdad.

98
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,012
One day he saw a stranger

99
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,292
looking at him in surprise,

100
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:47,572
and he knew that the stranger was Death.

101
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:50,532
Pale and trembling,
the merchant fled the marketplace

102
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:54,893
and made his way many, many miles,
to the city of Samarra.

103
00:04:56,173 --> 00:05:00,052
For there he was sure
Death could not find him.

104
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:02,012
But when, at last, he came to Samarra,

105
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:06,493
the merchant saw, waiting for him,
the grim figure of Death.

106
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:14,069
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in. I am yours."

107
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:19,052
"But tell me, why did you look surprised

108
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:21,293
when you saw me this
morning in Baghdad?"

109
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:26,212
"Because," said Death,

110
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:28,733
"I had an appointment with you tonight...

111
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,373
..in Samarra."

112
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:43,612
If this gets any better,
I'm going to get two knives.

113
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:44,732
Pays to advertise.

114
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,932
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.

115
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,812
I'm going to monitor the underworld,

116
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:52,692
every quiver of the web will tell
me when the spider makes his move.

117
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:54,732
So, basically,
your plan is just to sit there

118
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,892
solving crimes like you always do?

119
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:58,213
Awesome, isn't it?

120
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:02,892
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.

121
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:05,205
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?

122
00:06:05,227 --> 00:06:05,972
..sand.

123
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,573
Superficial.

124
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,132
Come back! It's the wrong thumb.

125
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:20,173
- Sherlock...
- It's never twins.

126
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,492
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.

127
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:26,212
- 'Wilson?' 'Lymph nodes?'
- Sherlock...

128
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:28,572
Yes, you may have nothing but
a limbless torso, but there'll

129
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:30,732
be traces of ink in the lymph
nodes under the armpits.

130
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,603
If your mystery corpse had tattoos,
the signs will be there.

131
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:35,372
- 'Bloody hell! Is that a guess?'
- I never guess.

132
00:06:35,373 --> 00:06:37,375
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?

133
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,612
The canary trainer?'

134
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:40,772
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'

135
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:42,092
Hm, naturally.

136
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:45,132
Sherlock, you can't go
on spinning plates like this.

137
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,972
That's it! The place was spinning.

138
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,772
The heart medication you're taking
is known to cause bouts of amnesia.

139
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:53,892
Yes, I... I think so. Why?

140
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,692
Because the fingerprints on your
brother's neck were your own.

141
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,852
- A jellyfish?
- I know.

142
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,355
You can't arrest a jellyfish.

143
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,964
- You could try.
- We did try.

144
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:05,468
Oh...

145
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,046
- Oh, God.
- Mary?

146
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:08,932
59 missed calls.

147
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:10,292
We're in a lot of trouble.

148
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:15,572
Ow! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

149
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:16,972
Relax, it's got two syllables...

150
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:19,172
I'm a nurse, darling -
I think I know what to do!

151
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,452
- Come on, then...
- Re! Lax!

152
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:24,932
No, just drive, please, God,
just drive! God, drive!

153
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:27,172
Sherlock - Mary!

154
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:29,292
That's it, Mary - re...

155
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:31,972
- Don't you start!
- ...lax.

156
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:36,292
John, John... I think
you have to pull over!

157
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,892
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!

158
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:42,053
Oh, my God!

159
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:48,372
Has that come out?

160
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:50,132
They never come out
when I take them.

161
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:51,012
Let's have a look.

162
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,573
Aw, she's so beautiful.

163
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,092
- Have another go.
- What about a name?

164
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:58,932
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.

165
00:07:58,933 --> 00:07:59,644
Have we?

166
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:00,532
- Yeah.
- Oh.

167
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:03,092
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.

168
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:06,452
Molly, Mrs H, we would
love you to be godparents.

169
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,563
- Oh! Really?
- If you...

170
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,372
That's so lovely.

171
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:14,412
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?

172
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:17,212
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.

173
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:19,412
God is a ludicrous fiction,
dreamt up by inadequates

174
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:22,372
who abnegate all responsibility
to an invisible magic friend.

175
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:24,292
Yeah, but there'll be cake. Will you do it?

176
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:25,572
I'll get back to you.

177
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:28,572
Father, we ask you to send
your blessings on this water

178
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:32,852
and sanctify it for our use this day.

179
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:34,692
In Christ's name.

180
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,612
Now, what name have you
given your daughter?

181
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:38,852
Rosamund Mary.

182
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,012
Rosamund?

183
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:42,653
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.

184
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:46,052
Didn't you get John's text?

185
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:50,492
No. I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."

186
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:53,332
No idea why people think you're
incapable of human emotion.

187
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,892
Sorry.

188
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:56,572
Phone!

189
00:08:56,573 --> 00:09:01,612
And now, godparents, are you ready
to help the parents of this child

190
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:04,052
in their duties as Christian parents?

191
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:05,692
We are.

192
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:08,332
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.

193
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,973
'Please repeat the question.'

194
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:14,052
As ever, Watson, you
see but do not observe.

195
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,412
To you, the world remains
an impenetrable mystery,

196
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:17,772
whereas, to me, it is an open book.

197
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:20,812
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy -
that is your choice.

198
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:23,732
You fail to connect actions
to their consequences.

199
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:26,932
Now, for the last time,
if you want to keep the rattle,

200
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,813
do not throw the rattle.

201
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,493
All right, good girl,
good girl. Good girl.

202
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,973
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?

203
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:48,588
- Hey.
- Afternoon.

204
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:50,652
He says you've got a good one, Greg?

205
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:53,052
Oh, yeah.

206
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,892
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.

207
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:01,652
God, 50!

208
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:02,772
Where does it go?

209
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:04,932
I know for a fact I was
only 21 this time last week.

210
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,772
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.

211
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:11,333
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."

212
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:15,132
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.

213
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,212
No. She's just jealous.

214
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:19,372
Yeah, well, I think we both are.

215
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,452
- Oh...
- No, no, David.

216
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:23,333
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...

217
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:26,892
Oh, no... Oh, it's a Skype call.

218
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:30,893
Oh! Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.

219
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:33,652
Oh, look! Hello!

220
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:36,332
'Hey, Dad. Happy birthday.

221
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:40,253
Sorry to miss the party,
but travel broadens the mind, right?'

222
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:44,332
No! Picture's frozen!

223
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,412
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'

224
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:48,092
Why is it rubbish? Where are you?

225
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:50,292
How is he? Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.

226
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,132
David? Come on!

227
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:55,172
OK, no, hang on a sec,
I'll find somewhere quieter.

228
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,132
So, Charlie, where are you?

229
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,852
Are you there?

230
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:01,812
- 'Sorry, I'm here. I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?

231
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,602
'It's nothing. Probably
just the altitude.'

232
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:05,532
Altitude?

233
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:07,562
'I'm in Tibet. Didn't
you see the mountains?'

234
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:08,532
Never mind mountains.

235
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,772
Your mother wants to know
if you're eating properly.

236
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,692
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?'
- What?

237
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:14,334
'Could you just check
something on my car?'

238
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,292
Your car?

239
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:17,452
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe

240
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:19,212
I've got a Power Ranger
stuck to the bonnet.

241
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:22,053
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.

242
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,732
All done. Have you got it?

243
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:28,893
Charlie?

244
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:33,012
A week later...

245
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:34,332
Yeah?

246
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,252
...something really weird happens.

247
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:40,132
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed,
the cops are chasing him,

248
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,412
and he turns into the drive
of the Welsborough house

249
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:43,932
to try and get away.

250
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:45,573
Unfortunately...

251
00:12:57,853 --> 00:13:00,252
The drunk guy survived,
they managed to pull him out,

252
00:13:00,253 --> 00:13:03,413
but when they put the fire out
and examined the parked car...

253
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:06,292
Whose body?

254
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:08,412
Charlie Welsborough, the son.

255
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,272
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.

256
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:11,532
DNA all checks out.

257
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,412
Night of the party, the car's empty,

258
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:15,492
and a week later...

259
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,052
the dead boy's found at the wheel.

260
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:21,612
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?

261
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:24,412
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's
the son of a Cabinet Minister,

262
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:26,452
so I'm under a lot of
pressure to get a result.

263
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:28,812
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.

264
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:30,893
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.

265
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:35,932
Made of vinyl.

266
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:38,332
Two different types of vinyl present.

267
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,932
Was it his own car?

268
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:41,892
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.

269
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:43,452
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?

270
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:46,252
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?

271
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:47,732
- There's something else.
- Yes?

272
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:48,812
According to this,

273
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:51,373
Charlie Welsborough had
already been dead for a week.

274
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:54,332
What?

275
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,652
The body in the car, dead for a week.

276
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:58,932
Oh, this is a good one. Is it my birthday?

277
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,492
You want help?

278
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:02,692
- Yes, please. OK.
- One condition.

279
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:05,692
Take all the credit. It gets
boring if I just solve them all.

280
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:06,852
Yeah, you say that,

281
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:09,292
but then John blogs about it,
and you get all the credit anyway.

282
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:10,452
He's got a point.

283
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:12,652
Which makes me look like
some kind of prima donna

284
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:14,932
who insists on getting credit
for something he didn't do!

285
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:16,812
Well, I think you've hit a
sore spot, Sherlock.

286
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:19,892
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.

287
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,023
So you take all the glory, thanks...

288
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:23,692
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.

289
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:26,412
Look, just solve the bloody thing,
will you? It's driving me nuts.

290
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:28,093
Anything you say, Giles.

291
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:31,772
Just kidding.

292
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:33,172
What's his name?

293
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,572
Greg. What?

294
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,812
Greg.

295
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,812
It's obvious though,
isn't it, what happened?

296
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,532
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?

297
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,772
Not a clue. It's just you
normally say that at this point.

298
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:47,524
Hmm. Well, then, let's hope you
solve your little problem, Greg.

299
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:49,533
- Hear that?
- I know.

300
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:54,372
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great. Yeah, amazing.

301
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:56,092
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.

302
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:58,812
You're at the beck and call of a
screaming, demanding baby,

303
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:01,572
woken up at all hours
to obey its every whim.

304
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:04,172
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?

305
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:05,652
Yes, well, you know how it is.

306
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,852
All you do is clean up their mess,
pat them on the head.

307
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,652
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.

308
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:13,172
Can't even tell people's faces apart.

309
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:14,412
This is a joke, isn't it?

310
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,052
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you
clever. You're so, so clever."

311
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:18,972
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.

312
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:20,863
You know, I think that
really might be it.

313
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:22,372
No, don't get it.

314
00:15:22,373 --> 00:15:25,092
Charlie's family are pretty cut
up about it, as you'd expect,

315
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:26,522
so go easy on them, yeah?

316
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:27,807
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'

317
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:29,348
Yeah. Got them, don't worry.

318
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:31,292
Pampers, the cream you
can't get from Boots.

319
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:33,212
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?

320
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:34,772
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.

321
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:37,012
'And what does he think? Any theories?'

322
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:38,612
Well, I texted you the details.

323
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:40,932
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.

324
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:42,332
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?

325
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,092
'Oh you'd be amazed at what
a receptionist picks up.'

326
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:47,892
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?'

327
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:48,977
I'm working on it.

328
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:50,492
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's
slowing you down.'

329
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:52,372
- Pig!
- Keep trying.

330
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,012
'So, what about it, then?

331
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:56,652
'What, an empty car that suddenly
has a week-old corpse in it?

332
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:58,532
'And what are you
going to call this one?'

333
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,252
Oh, the Ghost Driver.

334
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:02,172
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.

335
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:04,332
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.

336
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,012
No, never do that - people are stupid.

337
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:07,852
Uh, some people.

338
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:09,572
'All people are stupid.

339
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:10,852
Most people.'

340
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:12,652
'Bizarre enough though,
isn't it, to be him?'

341
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:14,373
I mean, it's right up your strasse.

342
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:19,452
Mr and Mrs Welsborough,
I really am most terribly sorry

343
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:20,755
to hear about your daughter.

344
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,452
- Son.
- Son!

345
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:23,892
Mr and Mrs Welsborough,
this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.

346
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:26,047
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.

347
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:29,532
If anyone can throw any light into
this darkness, surely it will be you.

348
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:31,373
Well, I believe that I...

349
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:34,053
...can.

350
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:38,133
But Charlie was our
whole world, Mr Holmes. I...

351
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:48,492
Sherlock?

352
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:49,652
Mr Holmes?

353
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:50,732
Sorry, you were saying?

354
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:53,252
Well, Charlie was our
whole world, Mr Holmes.

355
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:55,452
I... I don't think we'll
ever get over this.

356
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:56,853
No. Shouldn't think so.

357
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:04,173
So sorry, will you excuse
me a moment? I just...

358
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:08,933
I'll... I'll just, um... Ahem.

359
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,932
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...

360
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:18,532
By the pricking of my thumbs.

361
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:19,772
Seriously? You?

362
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,372
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.

363
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,092
They represent data processed too fast

364
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:24,652
for the conscious mind to comprehend.

365
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:26,172
What is this?

366
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:29,892
Oh, it's a sort of shrine,
I suppose, really.

367
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:31,972
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.

368
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:35,012
A big hero of mine when
I was getting started.

369
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,293
Right, yes.

370
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,732
- Who?
- What?

371
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:44,452
- Who...? Who was this?
- Are you serious?

372
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:47,572
- Sherlock...
- It's... It's Margaret Thatcher,

373
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:50,052
the first female Prime
Minister of this country.

374
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:51,172
Right.

375
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:54,493
- Prime Minister? Right.
- Leader of the Government.

376
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:57,048
- Female?
- For God's sake!

377
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:59,292
You know perfectly well who she is.

378
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:00,812
Why are you playing for time?

379
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,412
It's the gap, look at the gap. It's wrong.

380
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:06,213
Everything else is perfectly
ordered, managed.

381
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,732
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.

382
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,732
This figurine is routinely
repositioned after

383
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:14,002
the cleaner's been in,
this picture is straightened every day,

384
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,492
yet this ugly gap remains.

385
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:18,052
Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...

386
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:20,972
- Plaster bust...
- plaster bust. - Oh, for God's sake! It got broken.

387
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:23,092
What the hell has this
got to do with Charlie?

388
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:24,568
- Rug!
- What?

389
00:18:24,593 --> 00:18:25,492
Well, how could it get broken?

390
00:18:25,493 --> 00:18:28,572
The only place for it to fall is the
floor and there is a big thick rug.

391
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:31,052
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.

392
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:33,732
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?

393
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,652
No, he's an arsehole,
but it's an easy mistake.

394
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,932
Look, no, we had a break-in,
some little bastard smashed it to bits.

395
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,772
We found the remains
out there in the porch.

396
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:43,132
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much

397
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:45,492
they'd go to the trouble
of smashing her likeness...

398
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:48,092
I'm no expert,
but, uh, possibly her face.

399
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,412
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity,

400
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,012
and look at that one - she's smiling.

401
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:53,852
Oh, Inspector,
this is clearly a waste of time.

402
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:56,892
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.

403
00:18:56,893 --> 00:18:58,132
You do?

404
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:00,252
It's quite simple,
superficial, to be blunt.

405
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:02,252
But first, tell me,
the night of the break-in,

406
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:03,612
this room was in darkness?

407
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:05,852
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,

408
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,652
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,

409
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:10,012
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?

410
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:12,572
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.

411
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:14,972
So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.

412
00:19:14,973 --> 00:19:16,932
- Why?
- Don't know. Wouldn't be fun if I knew.

413
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:18,493
Mr Holmes, please!

414
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:23,212
It was your 50th birthday,
Mr Welsborough, of course you were

415
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:25,563
disappointed that your son hadn't
made it back from his gap year.

416
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,652
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.

417
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,452
- No.
- No?

418
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:32,372
Happy birthday...

419
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:36,052
The first part of your conversation was,
in fact, pre-recorded video.

420
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:37,333
Easily arranged.

421
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,772
It's a Skype call.

422
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:44,772
The trick was meant to be a surprise.

423
00:19:44,773 --> 00:19:46,892
- A trick?
- Obviously.

424
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:49,012
Could you take a photo and send it?

425
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:52,452
There were two types of vinyl in
the burnt-out remains of the car.

426
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:55,212
One, the actual passenger seat,
the other, a good copy.

427
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:56,373
Well, good enough.

428
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,465
Effectively a costume.

429
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:03,692
You're joking?

430
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:05,932
No, I'm not.

431
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:08,012
All he wanted was for you to
get close enough to the car

432
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:09,533
so he could spring the surprise.

433
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:15,573
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!

434
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:19,852
That's when it happened.

435
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:21,092
I can't be certain, of course,

436
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:23,892
but I think Charlie must have
suffered some sort of a seizure.

437
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:25,492
You said he'd felt unwell?

438
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:26,532
You all right?

439
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:29,252
'It's nothing. Probably
just the altitude.'

440
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:30,813
He died there and then.

441
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,292
No-one had any cause to go near his car,

442
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:40,373
so there he remained,
in the driver's seat, hidden, until...

443
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:48,292
When the two cars were examined,

444
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:52,252
the fake seat had melted in
the fire, revealing Charlie,

445
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:55,493
who'd been sitting there,
quite dead, for a week.

446
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:58,093
Oh, God!

447
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:00,972
Poor kid.

448
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:03,893
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.

449
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,092
This is where it was smashed.

450
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:10,801
- That was amazing.
- What?

451
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:12,212
The car, the kid.

452
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:14,292
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?

453
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:16,772
What's so important about a
broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?

454
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:19,372
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.

455
00:21:19,373 --> 00:21:20,852
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.

456
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:21,968
What kind of a life would that be?

457
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:24,551
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...

458
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,736
Miss me?

459
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:30,092
- That's mine. You two take a... bus.
- Why?

460
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:32,772
I need to concentrate,
and I don't want to hit you.

461
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:33,933
The Mall, please.

462
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:38,550
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?

463
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:40,332
Rather arrogant, I thought.

464
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,252
- You thought that?!
- Ha, I know.

465
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:43,493
Why am I looking at this?

466
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,772
That's her, John and Mary's baby.

467
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,932
Oh, I see, yes.

468
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,173
Looks very... fully functioning.

469
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,692
Is that really the best you can do?

470
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:56,932
Sorry, I've never been
very good with them.

471
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,172
- Babies?
- Humans.

472
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:02,492
Moriarty - did he have
any connection with Thatcher?

473
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:03,772
Any interest in her?

474
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:05,132
Why on earth would he?

475
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:07,173
I don't know. You tell me.

476
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,052
In the last year of his life,

477
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:14,732
James Moriarty was involved with
four political assassinations,

478
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,892
over 70 assorted robberies
and terrorist attacks,

479
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:20,532
including a chemical weapons
factory in North Korea,

480
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,572
and had latterly shown some interest

481
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:25,212
in tracking down the Black
Pearl of the Borgias,

482
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:26,732
which is still missing, by the way,

483
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:29,572
in case you feel like applying
yourself to something practical.

484
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:31,373
It's a pearl - get another one.

485
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:35,733
There's something important about this.

486
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:38,332
I'm sure.

487
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,652
Maybe it's Moriarty.

488
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:42,052
Maybe it's not.

489
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:45,293
But something's coming.

490
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,533
Are you having a premonition,
brother mine?

491
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:53,052
The world is woven from billions of lives,

492
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:54,732
every strand crossing every other.

493
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:57,173
What we call premonition is
just movement of the web.

494
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:01,572
If you could attenuate to
every strand of quivering data,

495
00:23:01,573 --> 00:23:03,932
the future would be entirely calculable.

496
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,853
As inevitable as mathematics.

497
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:10,252
- Appointment In Samarra.
- I'm sorry?

498
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:12,292
The merchant who can't outrun Death.

499
00:23:12,293 --> 00:23:14,692
You always hated that story as a child.

500
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,812
Less keen on predestination back then.

501
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,412
I'm not sure I like it now.

502
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:21,572
You wrote your own
version, as I remember.

503
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:23,412
Appointment In Sumatra.

504
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:27,172
The merchant goes to a different
city and is perfectly fine.

505
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,492
Goodnight, Mycroft.

506
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:30,572
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.

507
00:23:30,573 --> 00:23:32,321
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?

508
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:33,757
Absolutely no idea.

509
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:01,252
'Ammo!'

510
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:17,574
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.

511
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,837
You, uh...?

512
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:23,173
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...

513
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:27,492
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?

514
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:30,092
It's nothing. I mean
it's nothing serious.

515
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,777
- No, no.
- I just pop round every

516
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:33,292
now and again for a chat.

517
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:34,612
Yeah, of course.

518
00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:36,532
I mean he loves a really tricky case.

519
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:37,733
Yeah, he does!

520
00:24:38,695 --> 00:24:40,492
So what you here for?

521
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:42,932
Well, Interpol think
the Borgia Pearl trail

522
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:44,692
leads back to London, so...

523
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,332
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?

524
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,052
Yeah.

525
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:51,332
So, how did you two first meet?

526
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:54,332
Oh, well, there was a case about,
um, ten years ago.

527
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,452
Nobody could figure it out.

528
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,972
There was an old lady
found dead in a sauna.

529
00:24:57,973 --> 00:25:01,172
- Oh, yeah? How did she die?
- Hypothermia.

530
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:02,252
What?

531
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:04,852
I know, but then I met Sherlock,
it was so simple the way...

532
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:07,252
Will you two please keep it down?!

533
00:25:07,253 --> 00:25:08,412
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

534
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:10,692
Now, you haven't always been
in life insurance, have you?

535
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:13,452
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.

536
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:15,373
Your right hand's almost
an entire size bigger

537
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:17,212
than your left - hard
manual work does that.

538
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:19,332
I was a carpenter. Like me dad.

539
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,452
You're trying to give up smoking -
unsuccessfully -

540
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,516
and you once had a Japanese girlfriend

541
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,372
that meant a lot to you but
now you feel indifferent about.

542
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:26,852
How the hell...?

543
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:29,572
Ah... e-cigarettes.

544
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:31,572
Not just that - ten
individual e-cigarettes.

545
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,932
If you just wanted to smoke indoors,
you would've invested

546
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:36,052
in one of those irritating
electronic pipe things.

547
00:25:36,053 --> 00:25:38,812
But you're convinced you can give up,
so you don't want to buy a pipe,

548
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:40,612
because that means you're
not serious about quitting.

549
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:42,221
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes,

550
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:45,837
always sure that each will be
your last. Anything to add, John?

551
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:48,532
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.

552
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:50,932
- What is that?
- That is... me.

553
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,812
Well, it's a me substitute.

554
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:54,372
Don't be so hard on yourself.

555
00:25:54,373 --> 00:25:56,692
You know I value your
little contributions.

556
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:58,852
Yeah? It's been there
since nine this morning.

557
00:25:58,853 --> 00:26:01,292
- Has it? Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.

558
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,435
What about my girlfriend?

559
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,852
- What?
- You said I had an ex...

560
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,092
You've got a Japanese tattoo
in the crook of your elbow

561
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:07,412
in the name Akako.

562
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:09,252
It's obvious you've
tried to have it removed.

563
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:11,212
But surely that means
I want to forget her,

564
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:12,412
not that I'm indifferent.

565
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:15,372
If she'd really hurt your feelings,
you would've had the word obliterated.

566
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,213
The first attempt wasn't successful,
and you haven't tried again,

567
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:18,675
so it seems you can
live with the slightly

568
00:26:18,699 --> 00:26:21,143
blurred memory of Akako,
hence the indifference.

569
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:25,852
I... I thought you'd
done something clever.

570
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:29,292
Ah, now, but now you've explained it,
it's dead simple, innit?

571
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,892
I've withheld this information
from you until now, Mr Kingsley,

572
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,292
but I think it's time you knew the truth.

573
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:38,932
What do you mean?

574
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:41,652
Have you ever wondered if your wife
was a little bit out of your league?

575
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:43,692
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.

576
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:45,932
I'm afraid it's far worse than that,
your wife is a spy.

577
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:46,991
- What?
- That's right.

578
00:26:47,016 --> 00:26:49,052
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.

579
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:51,692
Swedish by birth and probably the
most dangerous spy in the world.

580
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,292
She's been operating deep undercover
for the past four years now

581
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,972
as your wife, for one reason only,
to get near the American Embassy,

582
00:26:56,973 --> 00:26:58,452
across the road from your flat.

583
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:00,412
Tomorrow the US President
will be at the embassy,

584
00:27:00,413 --> 00:27:01,932
as part of an official state visit.

585
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:04,452
As the President greets members
of staff, Greta Bengsdotter,

586
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:07,052
disguised as a 22-stone cleaner,
will inject the President

587
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:08,972
in the back of the neck
with a dangerous new drug,

588
00:27:08,973 --> 00:27:11,652
hidden inside a secret compartment
inside her padded armpit.

589
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:14,052
This drug will render the
President entirely susceptible

590
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:16,350
to the will of that new master,
none other than James Moriarty.

591
00:27:16,374 --> 00:27:16,948
What?

592
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:18,812
Moriarty will then use
the President as a pawn

593
00:27:18,813 --> 00:27:20,972
to destabilise the United
Nations General Assembly,

594
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,492
which is due to vote on a
nuclear non-proliferation treaty,

595
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:26,332
tipping the balance in favour of a
first-strike policy against Russia.

596
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,332
This chain of events will
then prove unstoppable,

597
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,172
thus precipitating World War III.

598
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:32,212
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.

599
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:33,972
His wife left him
because his breath stinks

600
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:35,452
and he likes to wear her lingerie.

601
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,252
I don't!

602
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:39,253
- Just the bras.
- Get out.

603
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:44,093
So, what's this all about, then?

604
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:46,313
- Having fun.
- Fun?

605
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:47,652
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.

606
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:51,212
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl. Boring. Go!

607
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:52,413
- But...
- Go!

608
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:56,133
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.

609
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:01,532
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.

610
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:03,772
No, it's another one, different owner.

611
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:05,052
Different part of town.

612
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:07,613
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.

613
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:12,252
What's wrong? I thought you'd be pleased.

614
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:14,652
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.

615
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:16,093
This is my game face.

616
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:18,813
And the game is on.

617
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:22,412
Another two have been smashed
since the Welsborough one.

618
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:25,132
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?

619
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:27,652
Yeah, and this one to a
Dr Barnicot in Holborn.

620
00:28:27,653 --> 00:28:30,212
Three in total. God knows who'd
want to do something like this.

621
00:28:30,213 --> 00:28:33,252
Yeah, but some people have that
complex, don't they? An idee fixe.

622
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,652
They obsess over one thing
and they can't let it go.

623
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:36,852
No, no good.

624
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:39,372
There were other images of
Margaret... Margaret...?

625
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:40,732
You know who she is.

626
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:42,532
...Thatcher, present at
the first break-in.

627
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:45,452
Why would a monomaniac
fixate on just one? Ooh!

628
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:46,653
- What?
- Blood.

629
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,799
Quite a bit of it, too.

630
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:52,132
Was there any injury at the crime scene?

631
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,532
Nah.

632
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:56,252
Then our suspect must have cut
themselves breaking the bust.

633
00:28:56,253 --> 00:28:57,665
- Come on.
- Holborn?

634
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,412
Lambeth!

635
00:28:58,413 --> 00:29:00,172
- Lambeth? Why?
- To see Toby.

636
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:01,892
Ah, right. Who?

637
00:29:01,893 --> 00:29:03,452
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?

638
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:05,892
No, he's got a lunch date with
a brunette forensic officer

639
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:07,332
that he doesn't want to be late for.

640
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,132
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket,

641
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:11,012
plus the formaldehyde
mixed with your cologne

642
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:13,372
and your complete inability
to stop looking at your watch.

643
00:29:13,373 --> 00:29:15,652
- Have a good time.
- I will.

644
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,532
Trust me, though,
she's not right for you.

645
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:19,852
- What?
- She's not the one.

646
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:22,292
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.

647
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,572
How do you work all that out?

648
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:25,972
She's got three children in Rio
that he doesn't know about.

649
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:26,942
Are you just making this up?

650
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,468
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?

651
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:30,692
There's a kid I know,
hacker, brilliant hacker,

652
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:31,892
one of the world's best.

653
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:33,332
Got himself into serious trouble

654
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,092
with the Americans a couple of years ago.

655
00:29:35,093 --> 00:29:36,932
He hacked into the
Pentagon security system,

656
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:39,372
and I managed to get him off the charge.

657
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:41,212
Therefore he owes me a favour.

658
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,478
So, how does that help us?

659
00:29:42,503 --> 00:29:44,172
- What?
- Toby the hacker?

660
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:45,813
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?

661
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:49,172
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?

662
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:51,492
Craig's got a dog.

663
00:29:51,493 --> 00:29:52,972
So I see.

664
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:54,332
Good boy!

665
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:56,212
Hiya!

666
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,132
Mary? What are you...?

667
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:00,732
No, we, we agreed we would
never bring Rosie out on a case.

668
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:03,372
No, exactly. So... don't wait up.

669
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:04,163
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.

670
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:05,492
Mary, what are you doing here?

671
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:06,805
She's better at this than you.

672
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,428
- Better?
- So I texted her.

673
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:10,172
Hang on, Mary's better than me?

674
00:30:10,173 --> 00:30:13,092
Well, she is a retired super-agent
with a terrifying skill-set.

675
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:15,972
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK. Nothing personal.

676
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:17,892
What, so I'm supposed to
just go home now, am I?

677
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:20,172
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?

678
00:30:20,173 --> 00:30:21,470
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!

679
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:22,143
- John.
- Well...

680
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:23,292
He's handy and loyal.

681
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:26,572
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?

682
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:29,612
Oh. Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?

683
00:30:29,613 --> 00:30:32,452
Keep up, he's fast.

684
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:34,333
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.

685
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,932
He's really not moving.

686
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:41,733
Slow but sure, John,
not dissimilar to yourself.

687
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:45,372
You just like this dog, don't you?

688
00:30:45,373 --> 00:30:47,653
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.

689
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:51,813
- Fascinating.
- Oh!

690
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:14,612
Well, what do you make of it?

691
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:17,492
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar,

692
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:20,333
they came specifically for
that Thatcher bust. Why?

693
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:48,372
Clever.

694
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,932
Well, if you were wounded and you
knew you were leaving a trail,

695
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:52,972
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.

696
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:54,972
Or blood in a butcher's.

697
00:31:54,973 --> 00:31:58,223
Never mind, Toby,
better luck next time, hmm?

698
00:31:58,248 --> 00:32:00,452
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.

699
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:01,692
Not Moriarty?

700
00:32:01,693 --> 00:32:04,972
It has to be him. It's too
bizarre, it's too baroque.

701
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:07,932
It's designed to beguile me,
tease me and lure me in.

702
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:11,373
At last, a noose for
me to put my neck into.

703
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:33,332
You should have seen the
state of the front room.

704
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:37,092
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh. Was Rosie's head spinning round?

705
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:41,333
- No. Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!

706
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:46,172
Now, you think we'd have noticed,
when she was born.

707
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:50,892
- Hmm? Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.

708
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:52,733
Hmm, that's The Omen.

709
00:32:54,653 --> 00:32:56,932
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.

710
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,172
They're two different things.

711
00:32:58,173 --> 00:33:00,572
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.

712
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:05,253
Yeah, can't she?

713
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:11,172
I'm coming, darling. Mummy's coming.

714
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:13,773
Oh, what are you doing?

715
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:18,372
What are you doing? Come here.

716
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:22,213
Have you heard of that thing? In Germany?

717
00:33:23,213 --> 00:33:25,372
You're going to have to be
more specific, Craig.

718
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:29,332
Ostalgie. People who missed the
old days under the communists.

719
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,652
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.

720
00:33:31,653 --> 00:33:35,012
According to this, there's quite
a market for Cold War memorabilia.

721
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:39,012
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?

722
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:41,772
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.

723
00:33:41,773 --> 00:33:44,492
Yes, fascinating. Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?

724
00:33:44,493 --> 00:33:47,572
I've got into the records of
the suppliers, Gelder and Co.

725
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:49,332
Seems they're from Georgia.

726
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,732
Where exactly?

727
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:54,852
Tbilisi. Batch of six.
One to Welsborough. One to Hassan.

728
00:33:54,853 --> 00:33:56,332
One to Dr Barnicot.

729
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,012
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.

730
00:33:58,013 --> 00:34:01,052
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.

731
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:02,332
Lestrade? Another one?

732
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,092
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?

733
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:08,212
Harker. And it's murder this time.

734
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,013
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.

735
00:34:20,253 --> 00:34:24,372
Defensive wounds on her face and
hands, throat cut. Sharp blade.

736
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:26,412
The same thing inside the house? The bust?

737
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:28,132
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.

738
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,732
That batch of statues was made
in Tbilisi several years ago.

739
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:33,132
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about

740
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:35,412
destroying them all. Makes
no sense. What's the point?

741
00:34:35,413 --> 00:34:38,012
No, they're not destroying them,
that's not what's happening.

742
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:39,932
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.

743
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,532
I've been slow, far too slow.

744
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:44,092
Well, I'm still being slow over here,
so if you wouldn't mind...

745
00:34:44,093 --> 00:34:45,612
Slow but lucky, very lucky.

746
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:48,892
And since they smashed both busts,
our luck might just hold.

747
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:51,532
Jack Sandeford of Reading
is where I'm going next.

748
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,332
Congratulations, by the way.

749
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,892
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.

750
00:34:55,893 --> 00:35:00,053
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.

751
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:18,973
That's enough now, love.

752
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:24,093
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.

753
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:28,093
And you need to get to bed. Come on.

754
00:36:00,213 --> 00:36:01,492
Wouldn't it be much simpler

755
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,853
to take out your grievances
at the polling station?

756
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:26,215
You were on the run. Nowhere
to hide your precious cargo.

757
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:31,132
You find yourself in a workshop,

758
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:33,852
plaster busts of the Iron
Lady drying, it's clever.

759
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:34,892
Very clever.

760
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:38,052
But now you've met me and
you're not so clever, are you?

761
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:39,092
Who are you?

762
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:40,693
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

763
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,653
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.

764
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:58,493
Argh!

765
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:10,692
You're out of time.

766
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:13,572
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?

767
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:16,292
I know it's him. It must be him.

768
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,532
You think you understand.

769
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:20,532
You understand nothing.

770
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:22,892
Well, before the police
come in and spoil things,

771
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:25,572
why don't we just enjoy the moment?

772
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:28,452
Let me present
Interpol's number one case.

773
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:30,692
Too tough for them, too boring for me.

774
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:34,653
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!

775
00:38:42,693 --> 00:38:43,893
It's not possible!

776
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:46,613
How could she...?!

777
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:53,212
Everything about who I was is on there.

778
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:56,452
The problems of your
past are your business.

779
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:58,333
The problems of your future...

780
00:38:59,893 --> 00:39:01,053
...are my privilege.

781
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:09,533
I don't understand.

782
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:12,892
She... She destroyed it.

783
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,373
She?

784
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:21,532
You know her! You do, don't you?

785
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,213
You know the bitch?!

786
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:26,327
She betrayed me.

787
00:39:27,093 --> 00:39:28,933
Betrayed us all. Mary.

788
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,692
This is about Mary?

789
00:39:31,693 --> 00:39:33,932
Is that what she's
calling herself now, eh?

790
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:36,982
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!'
- Give it to me.

791
00:39:38,373 --> 00:39:39,852
Give it to me!

792
00:39:39,853 --> 00:39:42,372
'Come out slowly, I want to see
your hands above your head.'

793
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:45,092
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.

794
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:48,132
'Lay down your weapon. Do it now!'

795
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:50,052
I'm leaving this place.

796
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:52,692
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.

797
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:54,732
'Lay down your weapon.'

798
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:57,353
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.

799
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:01,452
Tell her she's a dead woman.

800
00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:03,052
She's a dead woman walking.

801
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:07,132
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.

802
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:08,592
Who are you?

803
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:14,413
I'm the man who's going
to kill your friend.

804
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:17,493
Who's Sherlock Holmes?

805
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:19,933
Not a policeman.

806
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:47,493
What do you think? Mate in two?

807
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,452
Don't antagonise them, darling.

808
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:55,092
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.

809
00:40:55,093 --> 00:40:56,932
Everything palls.

810
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:59,252
They'll send someone soon.

811
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:01,812
They? Who are they?

812
00:41:01,813 --> 00:41:04,812
Seems to me we put an
awful lot of faith in they.

813
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:06,812
Well, I've got something
they would dearly love,

814
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:08,613
if only we could get out of here.

815
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:11,332
I've got Ammo.

816
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:12,893
Ammo?

817
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:38,852
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?

818
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:41,493
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!

819
00:41:45,453 --> 00:41:46,933
Veer left!

820
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,173
What now? What do we do?

821
00:42:05,013 --> 00:42:06,133
We die.

822
00:42:19,773 --> 00:42:21,612
Well?

823
00:42:21,613 --> 00:42:23,852
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.

824
00:42:23,853 --> 00:42:26,532
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?

825
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:28,853
Because I think he
used to work with Mary.

826
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:33,173
Ammo. Ammo. Ammo.

827
00:43:37,453 --> 00:43:41,253
Ammo. Ammo. Ammo.

828
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:49,612
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!

829
00:43:49,613 --> 00:43:51,252
We'll come back later.

830
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:55,372
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?

831
00:43:55,373 --> 00:43:57,093
What would you do to a traitor?

832
00:43:58,373 --> 00:44:01,532
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.

833
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:20,573
I am an idiot, I know nothing.

834
00:45:21,773 --> 00:45:23,732
Well, I've been telling
you that for ages.

835
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:25,773
That was quite a text you sent me.

836
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:28,812
What's going on, Sherlock?

837
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:30,692
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,

838
00:45:30,693 --> 00:45:33,092
I couldn't see what
was right under my nose.

839
00:45:33,093 --> 00:45:34,373
Expected a pearl.

840
00:45:40,453 --> 00:45:41,812
Oh, my God, that's a...

841
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:44,932
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John,

842
00:45:44,933 --> 00:45:46,972
except this one belongs to someone else.

843
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:47,652
Who?

844
00:45:47,653 --> 00:45:50,652
I don't know. We... We all
had one but the others were...

845
00:45:50,653 --> 00:45:52,548
Haven't you even looked at it yet?

846
00:45:52,573 --> 00:45:53,815
I glanced at it but I prefer

847
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,037
- to hear it from you.
- Why?

848
00:45:56,613 --> 00:45:59,053
Because I'll know the
truth when I hear it.

849
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:08,892
There were four of us, agents.

850
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:10,612
Not just agents.

851
00:46:10,613 --> 00:46:13,052
Polite term.

852
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:15,892
Alex. Gabriel.

853
00:46:15,893 --> 00:46:18,453
Me. And Ajay.

854
00:46:20,213 --> 00:46:24,372
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.

855
00:46:24,373 --> 00:46:26,492
We all had one.

856
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:29,732
Each containing aliases,
our background, everything.

857
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:31,332
We could never be betrayed,

858
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,132
because we had everything we
needed to destroy the other.

859
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:36,692
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.

860
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,332
I mean, we were at the
top of our game for years.

861
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:42,012
And then it all ended.

862
00:46:42,013 --> 00:46:44,412
There was a coup in Georgia.

863
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:47,132
The British Embassy in Tbilisi
was taken over, lots of hostages.

864
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:49,532
We got the call to go in, get them out.

865
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:52,052
There was a change of plan,
a last-minute adjustment.

866
00:46:52,053 --> 00:46:53,876
- Who from?
- I don't know,

867
00:46:53,901 --> 00:46:56,572
just another voice on the phone.

868
00:46:56,573 --> 00:46:58,013
And a codeword.

869
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:01,252
- Ammo.
- Ammo?

870
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:03,972
Like ammunition.

871
00:47:03,973 --> 00:47:06,373
We went in, but then
something went wrong.

872
00:47:07,413 --> 00:47:09,133
Something went really wrong.

873
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,732
That was six years ago.

874
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:27,652
It feels like forever.

875
00:47:27,653 --> 00:47:29,972
I was the only one that made it out.

876
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:31,452
No.

877
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:32,612
What?

878
00:47:32,613 --> 00:47:34,093
I met someone tonight.

879
00:47:36,293 --> 00:47:39,253
Same someone who's looking
for the sixth Thatcher.

880
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:49,252
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?

881
00:47:49,253 --> 00:47:50,653
Yeah, very much so.

882
00:47:51,853 --> 00:47:54,492
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,

883
00:47:54,493 --> 00:47:56,132
I thought I was the only one who got out.

884
00:47:56,133 --> 00:47:57,692
Where is he? I need to see him, now!

885
00:47:57,693 --> 00:48:01,092
Before you gave it to John,
did you keep your memory stick safe?

886
00:48:01,093 --> 00:48:03,812
Yeah, of course. It was our insurance.

887
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:06,052
Above all, they mustn't
fall into enemy hands.

888
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:08,372
So Ajay survived as well.

889
00:48:08,373 --> 00:48:11,012
And now he's looking for the
memory stick he managed to hide,

890
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,132
with all of AGRA's old aliases
on it, but why?

891
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:15,852
I don't know.

892
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:18,333
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?

893
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:25,932
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this,
but he wants you dead.

894
00:48:28,493 --> 00:48:32,372
Sorry, no, no, because
we... we were family.

895
00:48:32,373 --> 00:48:33,493
Families fall out.

896
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:37,572
The memory stick is the
easiest way to track you down.

897
00:48:37,573 --> 00:48:40,092
You're the only other survivor,
it must be you that he wants,

898
00:48:40,093 --> 00:48:42,812
and he's already killed
looking for the Thatcher bust.

899
00:48:42,813 --> 00:48:44,252
Well, he's just trying to find me.

900
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:45,972
He survived, that's all that matters!

901
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:47,772
I heard it from his own mouth.

902
00:48:47,773 --> 00:48:49,973
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."

903
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:54,813
Why would he want to kill me?

904
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:59,013
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.

905
00:49:01,013 --> 00:49:02,653
Well, it's what he believes.

906
00:49:09,773 --> 00:49:12,372
I suppose I was always
afraid this might happen.

907
00:49:12,373 --> 00:49:15,332
That something in my past would
come back to haunt me one day.

908
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:17,812
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.

909
00:49:17,813 --> 00:49:21,012
God, I just wanted a bit of peace,
and I really thought I had it.

910
00:49:21,013 --> 00:49:22,053
No, Mary...

911
00:49:23,613 --> 00:49:24,653
You do.

912
00:49:26,373 --> 00:49:27,693
I made a vow, remember?

913
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:30,933
To look after the three of you.

914
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,853
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.

915
00:49:35,053 --> 00:49:38,613
Stay close to me and I will keep
you safe from him, I promise you.

916
00:49:40,973 --> 00:49:43,452
There's something I think you should read.

917
00:49:43,453 --> 00:49:45,252
What is it?

918
00:49:45,253 --> 00:49:47,173
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.

919
00:49:51,493 --> 00:49:52,533
What are you...?

920
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:57,772
- Mary... Oh, no!
- There you go.

921
00:49:57,773 --> 00:50:01,693
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.

922
00:50:03,093 --> 00:50:04,133
No.

923
00:50:06,213 --> 00:50:09,093
You just look after them till
I get back. I'm sorry.

924
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:11,133
I'm so sorry.

925
00:50:42,093 --> 00:50:43,612
Agra?

926
00:50:43,613 --> 00:50:45,452
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna

927
00:50:45,453 --> 00:50:47,772
in the northern state of
Uttar Pradesh, India.

928
00:50:47,773 --> 00:50:50,812
It is 378km west of the state
capital, Lucknow.

929
00:50:50,813 --> 00:50:52,692
What are you, Wikipedia?

930
00:50:52,693 --> 00:50:54,612
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.

931
00:50:54,613 --> 00:50:56,332
Oh, good, I love an acronym.

932
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,772
All the best secret societies have them.

933
00:50:58,773 --> 00:51:01,372
Team of agents,
the best. But you know all that.

934
00:51:01,373 --> 00:51:02,892
Of course I do. Go on.

935
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,252
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary,
also one of the team.

936
00:51:06,253 --> 00:51:08,532
Indeed? Well, that's news to me.

937
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,852
Is it? He's already killed
looking for that memory stick.

938
00:51:11,853 --> 00:51:13,812
AGRA always worked
for the highest bidder,

939
00:51:13,813 --> 00:51:15,172
I thought that might include you?

940
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:16,892
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government,

941
00:51:16,893 --> 00:51:19,292
or whatever government
you're currently propping up.

942
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:23,492
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.

943
00:51:23,493 --> 00:51:25,772
They were sent in to free the hostages

944
00:51:25,773 --> 00:51:27,852
but it all went horribly wrong.

945
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:30,252
And that was that,
we stopped using freelancers.

946
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,572
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.

947
00:51:32,573 --> 00:51:36,212
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.

948
00:51:36,213 --> 00:51:39,439
I don't like loose ends. Not on my watch.

949
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,240
There was something else. A detail.

950
00:51:46,213 --> 00:51:47,253
A codeword.

951
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,812
Ammo?

952
00:51:50,813 --> 00:51:52,132
It's all I've got.

953
00:51:52,133 --> 00:51:53,612
Little enough.

954
00:51:53,613 --> 00:51:55,732
Could you do some digging as a favour?

955
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:57,972
You don't have many favours left.

956
00:51:57,973 --> 00:51:59,932
Then I'm calling them all in.

957
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:03,332
And if you can find who's after
her and neutralise them, what then?

958
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,292
You think you can go
on saving her forever?

959
00:52:05,293 --> 00:52:06,492
Of course.

960
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:08,092
Is that sentiment talking?

961
00:52:08,093 --> 00:52:09,813
No, it's me.

962
00:52:10,853 --> 00:52:13,092
Difficult to tell the
difference these days.

963
00:52:13,093 --> 00:52:16,772
Told you, I made a promise. A vow.

964
00:52:16,773 --> 00:52:19,015
All right. I'll see what I can do.

965
00:52:19,853 --> 00:52:22,212
But remember this, brother mine,

966
00:52:22,213 --> 00:52:25,772
agents like Mary tend not
to reach retirement age.

967
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:30,533
They get retired in a pretty
permanent sort of way.

968
00:52:32,093 --> 00:52:34,132
Not on my watch.

969
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:37,264
'My darling, I need to tell you this

970
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:39,892
because you mustn't
hate me for going away.'

971
00:52:39,893 --> 00:52:43,132
Pardon me,
I can hear a squeaking.

972
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:46,372
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.

973
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:49,492
Only I watched a documentary
on the Discovery Channel.

974
00:52:49,493 --> 00:52:51,092
Why Planes Fail.

975
00:52:51,093 --> 00:52:53,292
- Did you see it? Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.

976
00:52:53,293 --> 00:52:56,812
Swore I would never
fly again, yet hear I am!

977
00:52:56,813 --> 00:52:58,052
Everything OK, madam?

978
00:52:58,053 --> 00:53:01,212
No. No, no, it's not, but then
what's the use in complaining?

979
00:53:01,213 --> 00:53:05,132
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.

980
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:07,932
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.

981
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:10,092
Oh, OK. Relax.

982
00:53:10,093 --> 00:53:12,972
She said relax.

983
00:53:12,973 --> 00:53:15,332
Did you have a nice time in London?

984
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:18,852
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?

985
00:53:18,853 --> 00:53:22,613
Did you lose it in the war?

986
00:53:26,053 --> 00:53:29,373
'I gave myself permission
to have an ordinary life.

987
00:53:30,853 --> 00:53:32,972
I'm not running, I promise you that,

988
00:53:32,973 --> 00:53:35,852
I just need to do this in my own way.'

989
00:53:35,853 --> 00:53:39,492
Oh, God! I'm... I-I don't feel so good.

990
00:53:39,493 --> 00:53:40,612
Oh, my God!

991
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:48,692
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.

992
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:50,812
I don't feel so good.

993
00:53:50,813 --> 00:53:51,852
You're all right.

994
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:55,492
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.

995
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:56,853
God will smile on you.

996
00:54:00,373 --> 00:54:03,532
'But I don't want you and
Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,

997
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:05,093
I'm sorry, my love.'

998
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:20,013
I know you'll try to find
me but there is no point.

999
00:54:21,493 --> 00:54:25,132
Every move is random and not even
Sherlock Holmes can anticipate

1000
00:54:25,133 --> 00:54:26,333
the roll of a dice.

1001
00:54:31,013 --> 00:54:35,572
I need to move the target far,
far away from you

1002
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:38,333
and Rosie, and then I'll
come back, my darling.

1003
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:41,053
I swear I will.'

1004
00:56:17,933 --> 00:56:20,412
Not like this one.

1005
00:56:20,413 --> 00:56:22,813
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.

1006
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:27,252
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!

1007
00:56:27,253 --> 00:56:32,092
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.

1008
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:34,292
Mr Baker. Well, that completes the set.

1009
00:56:34,293 --> 00:56:36,692
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?

1010
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,772
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.

1011
00:56:38,773 --> 00:56:40,692
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?

1012
00:56:40,693 --> 00:56:43,092
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm
not familiar with the concept.

1013
00:56:43,093 --> 00:56:44,572
Oh, hi, Mary.

1014
00:56:44,573 --> 00:56:45,732
What concept?

1015
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:48,372
Happy families. Nice trip?

1016
00:56:48,373 --> 00:56:51,892
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.

1017
00:56:51,893 --> 00:56:54,532
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.

1018
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:56,372
Hello.

1019
00:56:56,373 --> 00:56:58,532
Karim, would you be so kind
as to fetch us some tea?

1020
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:00,692
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1021
00:57:00,693 --> 00:57:02,133
Nice to meet you, missus.

1022
00:57:05,493 --> 00:57:08,332
No, I mean how did you find me?

1023
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:09,852
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

1024
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:11,292
No, really, though, how?

1025
00:57:11,293 --> 00:57:13,532
Every movement I made was entirely random,

1026
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:17,012
every new personality just
on the roll of a dice!

1027
00:57:17,013 --> 00:57:18,732
Mary, no human action
is ever truly random.

1028
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:20,892
An advanced grasp of the
mathematics of probability,

1029
00:57:20,893 --> 00:57:23,692
mapped onto a thorough apprehension
of human psychology and the

1030
00:57:23,693 --> 00:57:25,532
known dispositions of
any given individual,

1031
00:57:25,533 --> 00:57:27,532
can reduce the number of
variables considerably.

1032
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:29,452
I myself know of at least
58 techniques to refine

1033
00:57:29,453 --> 00:57:32,452
a seemingly infinite array of
randomly generated possibilities

1034
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:34,853
down to the smallest number
of feasible variables.

1035
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:37,532
But they're really difficult,

1036
00:57:37,557 --> 00:57:40,667
so instead I just stuck a tracer
on the inside of the memory stick.

1037
00:57:42,013 --> 00:57:44,092
Oh, you bastard!

1038
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,852
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!

1039
00:57:46,853 --> 00:57:48,852
"The mathematics of probability"?

1040
00:57:48,853 --> 00:57:51,092
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?

1041
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,412
Yes, I started to run out about then.

1042
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:54,852
In the memory stick!

1043
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:56,413
Yeah, that was my idea.

1044
00:58:07,293 --> 00:58:09,492
- AGRA?
- Yes.

1045
00:58:09,493 --> 00:58:11,693
Uh-huh. You said it was your initials.

1046
00:58:14,493 --> 00:58:15,732
In a way that was true.

1047
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:19,173
In a way? So many lies.

1048
00:58:20,853 --> 00:58:22,772
I'm so sorry.

1049
00:58:22,773 --> 00:58:24,612
And I don't just mean you.

1050
00:58:24,613 --> 00:58:26,452
What?

1051
00:58:26,453 --> 00:58:29,332
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...

1052
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:31,933
You're R?

1053
00:58:34,893 --> 00:58:35,933
Rosamund?

1054
00:58:37,373 --> 00:58:38,973
Rosamund Mary.

1055
00:58:41,413 --> 00:58:42,573
I always liked Mary.

1056
00:58:43,693 --> 00:58:44,813
Yeah, me too.

1057
00:58:47,613 --> 00:58:48,733
I used to.

1058
00:58:50,253 --> 00:58:52,012
I just... I didn't know what else to do.

1059
00:58:52,013 --> 00:58:53,996
You could have stayed,
you could have talked to me.

1060
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:57,893
That's what couples are supposed
to do. Work things through.

1061
00:58:59,773 --> 00:59:00,813
Yes.

1062
00:59:02,653 --> 00:59:03,972
Yes, of course.

1063
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:05,853
Mary, I may not be a very good man...

1064
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:09,812
...but I think I'm a bit better
than you give me credit for,

1065
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:11,533
- most of the time.
- All the time.

1066
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:15,492
You're always a good man,
John, I've never doubted that.

1067
00:59:15,493 --> 00:59:17,652
You never judge, you never complain.

1068
00:59:17,653 --> 00:59:19,533
I don't deserve you, I...

1069
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:26,093
All I ever wanted to do was keep
you and Rosie safe, that's all.

1070
00:59:30,373 --> 00:59:32,081
I will keep you safe.

1071
00:59:35,053 --> 00:59:36,812
But it has to be in London.

1072
00:59:36,813 --> 00:59:38,453
It's my city, I know the turf.

1073
00:59:40,853 --> 00:59:44,093
Come home and everything will
be all right, I promise you.

1074
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,412
Get down!

1075
00:59:53,893 --> 00:59:54,932
Hello again.

1076
00:59:54,933 --> 00:59:57,292
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.

1077
00:59:57,293 --> 01:00:00,212
Look, I thought you were dead,
believe me, I did.

1078
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:03,292
I've been looking forward to this
for longer than you can imagine.

1079
01:00:03,293 --> 01:00:05,892
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.

1080
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:09,052
I thought I was the only one who got out.

1081
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:10,852
How did you find us?

1082
01:00:10,853 --> 01:00:14,332
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.

1083
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:17,932
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.

1084
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:21,293
And now here we are. At last.

1085
01:00:24,693 --> 01:00:26,572
Touche!

1086
01:00:26,573 --> 01:00:29,812
Listen, whatever you think you know,
we can talk about this,

1087
01:00:29,813 --> 01:00:30,972
we can work it out.

1088
01:00:30,973 --> 01:00:32,253
She thought I was dead.

1089
01:00:33,613 --> 01:00:35,252
I might as well have been.

1090
01:00:35,253 --> 01:00:38,212
It was always just the four of us,
always, remember?

1091
01:00:38,213 --> 01:00:39,252
Oh, yeah.

1092
01:00:39,253 --> 01:00:40,852
So why do you want to kill me?

1093
01:00:40,853 --> 01:00:44,013
Do you know how long they kept me
prisoner? What they did to me?

1094
01:00:45,053 --> 01:00:46,853
They tortured Alex to death.

1095
01:00:47,973 --> 01:00:51,212
I can still hear the sound of
his back breaking. But you?

1096
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:52,372
You, where were you?

1097
01:00:52,373 --> 01:00:54,572
That day at the embassy, I escaped.

1098
01:00:54,573 --> 01:00:55,612
Ha!

1099
01:00:55,613 --> 01:00:58,892
But I lost sight of you too, so you
explain. Where were you?

1100
01:00:58,893 --> 01:01:02,212
Oh, I got out. For a while.

1101
01:01:02,213 --> 01:01:04,372
Long enough to hide my memory stick.

1102
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:06,172
I didn't want that to
fall into their hands.

1103
01:01:06,173 --> 01:01:08,932
I was loyal, you see.

1104
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:10,693
Loyal to my friends.

1105
01:01:11,693 --> 01:01:15,213
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.

1106
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,493
Not for anything except fun.

1107
01:01:21,493 --> 01:01:24,332
They thought I'd give in, die,

1108
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:25,773
but I didn't, I lived.

1109
01:01:27,213 --> 01:01:30,292
And eventually, they forgot about
me rotting in a cell somewhere.

1110
01:01:30,293 --> 01:01:32,431
Six years they kept me there.

1111
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:35,220
Until one day I saw my chance.

1112
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:38,212
Oh, and I made them pay.

1113
01:01:38,213 --> 01:01:42,132
You know, all the time I was there,
I just kept picking up things.

1114
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:45,812
Little whispers. Laughter. Gossip.

1115
01:01:45,813 --> 01:01:49,092
How the clever agents had been betrayed.

1116
01:01:49,093 --> 01:01:50,772
Brought down by you!

1117
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:53,053
Me?

1118
01:02:01,133 --> 01:02:03,813
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.

1119
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:07,052
What, you think I care if I die?

1120
01:02:07,053 --> 01:02:08,853
I've dreamed of killing you...

1121
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:13,092
...every night for six years.

1122
01:02:13,093 --> 01:02:17,372
Of squeezing the life out of
your treacherous, lying throat.

1123
01:02:17,373 --> 01:02:19,692
I swear to you, Ajay.

1124
01:02:19,693 --> 01:02:21,652
What did you hear, Ajay?

1125
01:02:21,653 --> 01:02:25,035
When you were a prisoner,
what exactly did you hear?

1126
01:02:27,032 --> 01:02:28,232
What did I hear?

1127
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:30,592
Ammo.

1128
01:02:32,253 --> 01:02:35,492
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.

1129
01:02:35,493 --> 01:02:37,812
Ammo.

1130
01:02:37,813 --> 01:02:40,173
Ammo. Ammo."

1131
01:02:41,653 --> 01:02:43,612
We were betrayed!

1132
01:02:43,613 --> 01:02:45,812
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!

1133
01:02:45,813 --> 01:02:46,932
They said her name?

1134
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,052
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.

1135
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:51,893
No! No!

1136
01:02:59,813 --> 01:03:02,532
'The English woman, that's all he heard.

1137
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:04,412
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'

1138
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,292
Couldn't this wait until you're back?

1139
01:03:06,293 --> 01:03:07,372
No, it's not over.

1140
01:03:07,373 --> 01:03:09,172
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed,

1141
01:03:09,173 --> 01:03:11,492
the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.

1142
01:03:11,493 --> 01:03:13,332
There was only a voice on the phone.

1143
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:15,052
'Remember? And a codeword.'

1144
01:03:15,053 --> 01:03:17,172
"Ammo," yes, you said.

1145
01:03:17,173 --> 01:03:19,572
How's your Latin, brother dear?

1146
01:03:19,573 --> 01:03:20,812
My Latin?

1147
01:03:20,813 --> 01:03:23,053
Amo, amas, amat.

1148
01:03:24,293 --> 01:03:26,972
I love, you love, he loves. What...?

1149
01:03:26,973 --> 01:03:30,293
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition,
but "Amo", meaning?

1150
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,813
You'd better be right, Sherlock.

1151
01:03:52,533 --> 01:03:54,053
Bloody thing!

1152
01:03:56,493 --> 01:03:58,012
What's going on?

1153
01:03:58,013 --> 01:03:59,892
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood,

1154
01:03:59,893 --> 01:04:02,852
your security protocols have
been temporarily rescinded.

1155
01:04:02,853 --> 01:04:03,893
What?

1156
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:18,373
'So many lies. And I don't just mean you.'

1157
01:04:44,533 --> 01:04:47,132
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.

1158
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,092
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.

1159
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:50,917
It's not really me,
though, I think.

1160
01:04:50,942 --> 01:04:52,692
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.

1161
01:04:52,693 --> 01:04:55,692
I'm more of a "knackered with
weary old eyes" kind of guy.

1162
01:04:55,693 --> 01:04:57,293
Well, I think they're nice.

1163
01:04:59,653 --> 01:05:00,892
Nice eyes.

1164
01:05:00,893 --> 01:05:03,412
- Thank you.
- Look... Look...

1165
01:05:03,413 --> 01:05:04,892
I don't normally do this,

1166
01:05:04,893 --> 01:05:06,692
- but, um...
- But you're going to.

1167
01:05:06,693 --> 01:05:07,813
Yeah.

1168
01:05:11,213 --> 01:05:13,532
- What's this?
- This is me.

1169
01:05:13,533 --> 01:05:17,452
- Thank you. Cheers.
- Yeah. Great.

1170
01:05:17,453 --> 01:05:18,693
- Bye!
- Bye.

1171
01:06:24,053 --> 01:06:26,932
Now, you think we'd have noticed,
when she was born.

1172
01:06:26,933 --> 01:06:28,053
Hmm? Noticed what?

1173
01:06:29,053 --> 01:06:31,613
The little 666 on her forehead.

1174
01:06:33,053 --> 01:06:34,893
Hmm, that's The Omen.

1175
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,172
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.

1176
01:06:39,173 --> 01:06:40,692
They're two different things.

1177
01:06:40,693 --> 01:06:43,492
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.

1178
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:47,893
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.

1179
01:06:49,253 --> 01:06:51,532
I'm coming darling. I'm coming.

1180
01:06:53,533 --> 01:06:56,172
Oh, what are you doing?

1181
01:06:56,173 --> 01:06:58,292
What are you doing?

1182
01:06:58,293 --> 01:07:00,212
- Come here...

1183
01:07:00,213 --> 01:07:01,893
It's OK.

1184
01:07:05,093 --> 01:07:07,812
- Do you want a cuddle?

1185
01:07:14,253 --> 01:07:16,773
I know.

1186
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:21,573
- Oh, sweetheart.

1187
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:29,813
Ssh. Oh, you're not going to
stop crying, are you?

1188
01:07:31,413 --> 01:07:33,972
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?

1189
01:07:33,973 --> 01:07:35,773
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!

1190
01:07:36,773 --> 01:07:39,692
Daddy's here. It's OK, Rosie.

1191
01:07:39,693 --> 01:07:41,052
I'll take her.

1192
01:07:41,053 --> 01:07:43,052
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.

1193
01:07:43,053 --> 01:07:46,412
Hey, baby, it's Daddy. Your daddy.

1194
01:07:46,413 --> 01:07:49,293
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.

1195
01:07:51,093 --> 01:07:52,413
Thank you.

1196
01:08:41,933 --> 01:08:45,092
This is absolutely
ridiculous and you know it.

1197
01:08:45,093 --> 01:08:46,772
How many more times?

1198
01:08:46,773 --> 01:08:51,372
Six years ago you held the brief for
Foreign Operations, code name Love.

1199
01:08:51,373 --> 01:08:54,252
And you're basing all
this on a code name?

1200
01:08:54,253 --> 01:08:58,492
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.

1201
01:08:58,493 --> 01:09:00,572
You were the conduit for AGRA.

1202
01:09:00,573 --> 01:09:03,572
Every assignment,
every detail they got from you.

1203
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:05,372
It was my job.

1204
01:09:05,373 --> 01:09:07,932
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.

1205
01:09:07,933 --> 01:09:09,292
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.

1206
01:09:09,293 --> 01:09:10,693
Not by me.

1207
01:09:14,093 --> 01:09:16,693
Mycroft, we have known
each other a long time.

1208
01:09:18,693 --> 01:09:19,732
I promise you,

1209
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:23,132
I haven't the foggiest idea
what all this is about.

1210
01:09:23,133 --> 01:09:27,052
You wound up AGRA and all
the other freelancers.

1211
01:09:27,053 --> 01:09:31,572
I haven't done any of the
things you're accusing me of.

1212
01:09:31,573 --> 01:09:32,733
Not one.

1213
01:09:35,053 --> 01:09:37,333
Not. One.

1214
01:09:53,213 --> 01:09:56,492
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.

1215
01:09:56,493 --> 01:09:57,532
Yeah?

1216
01:09:57,533 --> 01:10:00,052
Yeah. I just make a series of
gurgling noises at the moment.

1217
01:10:00,053 --> 01:10:02,532
Although she does seem to enjoy them.

1218
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:04,333
Well, I'll have to give that a go.

1219
01:10:05,613 --> 01:10:06,933
Got a lot to catch up on.

1220
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:27,293
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'

1221
01:10:30,813 --> 01:10:34,532
'Code names Antarctica,
Langdale, Porlock and Love.'

1222
01:10:34,533 --> 01:10:36,772
'You'd be amazed at
what a receptionist picks up.

1223
01:10:36,773 --> 01:10:37,932
'They know everything.'

1224
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:40,012
'They said it was the English woman.'

1225
01:10:40,013 --> 01:10:41,972
'Don't minute any of this.'

1226
01:10:41,973 --> 01:10:44,253
'They know everything.'

1227
01:10:55,733 --> 01:10:58,413
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?

1228
01:10:59,413 --> 01:11:02,493
Well, being... being so perfect.

1229
01:11:05,573 --> 01:11:09,612
Mary, I... I need to tell you...

1230
01:11:09,613 --> 01:11:12,492
Hang on.

1231
01:11:12,493 --> 01:11:13,733
Can you tell me later?

1232
01:11:15,093 --> 01:11:17,053
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Great.

1233
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:19,772
Well, no, we can't just go.

1234
01:11:19,773 --> 01:11:20,938
- Rosie.
- Yeah.

1235
01:11:20,963 --> 01:11:21,812
- Er, you go.
- No!

1236
01:11:21,813 --> 01:11:23,932
I'll come as soon as I've found
someone. Mrs Hudson.

1237
01:11:23,933 --> 01:11:25,852
- Corfu till Saturday. Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.

1238
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:27,572
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.

1239
01:11:27,573 --> 01:11:29,012
You know that's not going to happen.

1240
01:11:29,013 --> 01:11:30,852
If there's more to this case,
you need to see it.

1241
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,013
Yeah, OK, you win.

1242
01:11:46,373 --> 01:11:51,332
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium
will be closing in five minutes.

1243
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:54,413
'Please make your way to
the exit. Thank you.'

1244
01:12:05,773 --> 01:12:08,452
Your office said I'd find you here.

1245
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:11,493
This was always my favourite
spot for agents to meet.

1246
01:12:13,533 --> 01:12:16,332
We're like them.

1247
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,852
Ghostly, living in the shadows.

1248
01:12:18,853 --> 01:12:20,492
Predatory?

1249
01:12:20,493 --> 01:12:23,412
Well, it depends which side you're on.

1250
01:12:23,413 --> 01:12:26,092
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.

1251
01:12:26,093 --> 01:12:27,652
Nice location for the final act,

1252
01:12:27,653 --> 01:12:29,612
couldn't have chosen it better myself.

1253
01:12:29,613 --> 01:12:31,692
But then I never could resist
a touch of the dramatic.

1254
01:12:31,693 --> 01:12:33,453
I just come here to look at the fish.

1255
01:12:35,506 --> 01:12:37,066
I knew this would happen one day.

1256
01:12:39,173 --> 01:12:41,452
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.

1257
01:12:41,453 --> 01:12:43,092
Would you mind cutting to the chase?

1258
01:12:43,093 --> 01:12:44,812
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?

1259
01:12:44,813 --> 01:12:46,292
With good reason.

1260
01:12:46,293 --> 01:12:50,453
"There was once a merchant,
in a famous market in Baghdad."

1261
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:54,092
I really have never liked this story.

1262
01:12:54,093 --> 01:12:56,372
I'm just like the merchant in the story,

1263
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:59,092
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.

1264
01:12:59,093 --> 01:13:01,372
I've always been looking over my shoulder,

1265
01:13:01,373 --> 01:13:04,012
always expecting to see
the grim figure of...

1266
01:13:04,037 --> 01:13:04,892
Death.

1267
01:13:04,893 --> 01:13:05,923
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.

1268
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,037
- John?
- On his way.

1269
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:09,573
Let me introduce Ammo.

1270
01:13:10,773 --> 01:13:11,893
You were Ammo?

1271
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:15,052
You were the person
on the phone that time?

1272
01:13:15,053 --> 01:13:17,532
Using AGRA as her private
assassination unit.

1273
01:13:17,533 --> 01:13:19,372
Why did you betray us?

1274
01:13:19,373 --> 01:13:20,892
Why does anyone do anything?

1275
01:13:20,893 --> 01:13:23,012
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?

1276
01:13:23,013 --> 01:13:25,333
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.

1277
01:13:26,373 --> 01:13:27,972
Worked very well for a few years.

1278
01:13:27,973 --> 01:13:30,292
I bought a nice cottage in
Cornwall on the back of it.

1279
01:13:30,293 --> 01:13:32,572
But...

1280
01:13:32,573 --> 01:13:36,652
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.

1281
01:13:36,653 --> 01:13:39,932
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.

1282
01:13:39,933 --> 01:13:42,412
I couldn't believe my luck!

1283
01:13:42,413 --> 01:13:43,972
That bought me a little time.

1284
01:13:43,973 --> 01:13:46,212
But then you found out
your boss had sent AGRA in.

1285
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:49,212
Very handy. They were
always such reliable killers.

1286
01:13:49,213 --> 01:13:50,892
What you didn't know, Mary,

1287
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:54,212
was that this one also tipped
off the hostage-takers.

1288
01:13:54,213 --> 01:13:56,612
Lady Smallwood gave the order.

1289
01:13:56,613 --> 01:13:59,492
But I sent another one to the terrorists,

1290
01:13:59,493 --> 01:14:02,172
with a nice little clue
about her code name,

1291
01:14:02,173 --> 01:14:05,092
should anyone have an enquiring mind.

1292
01:14:05,093 --> 01:14:06,892
Seemed to do the trick.

1293
01:14:06,893 --> 01:14:09,012
And you thought your troubles were over.

1294
01:14:09,013 --> 01:14:11,452
I was tired.

1295
01:14:11,453 --> 01:14:13,573
Tired of the mess of it all.

1296
01:14:15,573 --> 01:14:18,773
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.

1297
01:14:20,653 --> 01:14:22,132
The hostages were killed.

1298
01:14:22,133 --> 01:14:24,532
AGRA too.

1299
01:14:24,533 --> 01:14:26,732
Or so I thought.

1300
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:28,173
My secret was safe.

1301
01:14:29,813 --> 01:14:31,413
But... apparently not.

1302
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:35,173
Just a little peace.

1303
01:14:36,413 --> 01:14:38,732
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?

1304
01:14:38,733 --> 01:14:41,972
A family? Home?

1305
01:14:41,973 --> 01:14:43,293
Really, I understand.

1306
01:14:46,013 --> 01:14:49,812
So, just let me get out of here, right?

1307
01:14:49,813 --> 01:14:51,612
Let me just walk away.

1308
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:54,173
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.

1309
01:14:56,613 --> 01:14:57,652
What do you say?

1310
01:14:57,653 --> 01:14:59,372
After what you did?!

1311
01:14:59,373 --> 01:15:00,413
Mary, no!

1312
01:15:01,773 --> 01:15:02,853
OK.

1313
01:15:05,573 --> 01:15:08,373
London Aquarium. Yes, now.

1314
01:15:11,213 --> 01:15:12,932
I was never a field agent.

1315
01:15:12,933 --> 01:15:15,332
I always thought I'd be rather good.

1316
01:15:16,813 --> 01:15:19,572
Well, you handled the
operation in Tbilisi very well.

1317
01:15:19,573 --> 01:15:20,852
Thanks.

1318
01:15:20,853 --> 01:15:22,532
- For a secretary.
- What?

1319
01:15:22,533 --> 01:15:24,932
It can't have been easy all those
years, sitting in the back,

1320
01:15:24,933 --> 01:15:27,372
keeping your mouth shut when
you knew you were cleverer than

1321
01:15:27,373 --> 01:15:28,572
most of the people in the room.

1322
01:15:28,573 --> 01:15:31,790
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?

1323
01:15:33,013 --> 01:15:35,932
Same old drudge, day in, day out.

1324
01:15:35,933 --> 01:15:39,052
Never getting out there
where all the excitement was.

1325
01:15:39,053 --> 01:15:42,252
Just back to your little
flat on Wigmore Street.

1326
01:15:42,253 --> 01:15:45,532
They've taken up the pavement
outside the post office there.

1327
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:47,692
The local clay on your
shoes is very distinctive.

1328
01:15:47,693 --> 01:15:49,238
Yes, your little flat.

1329
01:15:49,263 --> 01:15:50,172
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary,

1330
01:15:50,173 --> 01:15:51,292
it would have to be modest,

1331
01:15:51,293 --> 01:15:53,612
and you spent all the money on
that cottage, didn't you?

1332
01:15:53,613 --> 01:15:55,492
And what are you, widowed or divorced?

1333
01:15:55,493 --> 01:15:57,852
Wedding ring is at least 30
years old and you've moved it

1334
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:00,812
to another finger. That means
you're sentimentally attached to it,

1335
01:16:00,813 --> 01:16:02,052
but you're not still married.

1336
01:16:02,053 --> 01:16:04,772
I favour widowed, given the number
of cats you share your life with.

1337
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:06,732
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell,

1338
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:08,532
judging by the cat
hairs on your cardigan.

1339
01:16:08,533 --> 01:16:10,692
A divorcee is more likely
to look for a new partner,

1340
01:16:10,693 --> 01:16:13,132
a widow to fill the void
left by her dead husband.

1341
01:16:13,133 --> 01:16:15,492
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.

1342
01:16:15,493 --> 01:16:17,132
There's clearly no-one new in your life,

1343
01:16:17,133 --> 01:16:19,732
or you wouldn't be spending your
Friday nights in an aquarium.

1344
01:16:19,733 --> 01:16:21,372
That accounts for the drink problem too,

1345
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:22,692
the slight tremor in your hand,

1346
01:16:22,693 --> 01:16:24,332
the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.

1347
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:28,133
So, yes, I'd say jealousy
was your motive after all.

1348
01:16:29,773 --> 01:16:31,213
To prove how good you are.

1349
01:16:32,253 --> 01:16:35,613
To make up for the inadequacies
of your... little life.

1350
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,052
Well, Mrs Norbury,

1351
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:40,932
I must admit this is unexpected.

1352
01:16:40,933 --> 01:16:43,092
Vivian Norbury,

1353
01:16:43,093 --> 01:16:45,972
who out-smarted them all.

1354
01:16:45,973 --> 01:16:47,973
All except Sherlock Holmes.

1355
01:16:51,453 --> 01:16:52,573
There's no way out.

1356
01:16:54,373 --> 01:16:55,693
So it would seem.

1357
01:16:57,573 --> 01:16:59,532
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.

1358
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:00,573
It's what I do.

1359
01:17:02,573 --> 01:17:05,372
Maybe I can still surprise you.

1360
01:17:05,373 --> 01:17:07,533
Now, come on, be sensible.

1361
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,853
Hmm, no, I don't think so.

1362
01:17:22,493 --> 01:17:24,892
Ah! Surprise!

1363
01:17:29,893 --> 01:17:32,172
Everything's fine. It's going to be OK.

1364
01:17:32,173 --> 01:17:34,332
Get an ambulance!

1365
01:17:34,357 --> 01:17:35,505
It's all right, it's all right.

1366
01:17:35,506 --> 01:17:37,132
- Mary!
- John.

1367
01:17:37,133 --> 01:17:41,292
All right, Mary? Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.

1368
01:17:41,293 --> 01:17:43,132
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.

1369
01:17:43,133 --> 01:17:45,492
Come on, Doctor,
you can do better than that.

1370
01:17:45,493 --> 01:17:46,652
Come on, Mary. Mary?

1371
01:17:46,653 --> 01:17:48,572
Oh, God. John, I think this is it.

1372
01:17:48,573 --> 01:17:50,012
No, no, no, no. It's not.

1373
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:52,732
- That's...
- You made me so happy.

1374
01:17:52,733 --> 01:17:56,852
You gave me everything I could ever,
ever have wanted...

1375
01:17:56,853 --> 01:17:59,492
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.

1376
01:17:59,493 --> 01:18:01,372
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.

1377
01:18:01,373 --> 01:18:02,624
- Promise me.
- I promise.

1378
01:18:02,649 --> 01:18:03,932
- No...
- Yes, I promise.

1379
01:18:03,933 --> 01:18:07,852
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise. Ssh, ssh.

1380
01:18:07,853 --> 01:18:09,372
Hey, Sherlock.

1381
01:18:09,373 --> 01:18:10,412
Yes.

1382
01:18:10,413 --> 01:18:11,812
I...

1383
01:18:11,813 --> 01:18:14,412
so like you.

1384
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:15,813
Did I ever say?

1385
01:18:17,133 --> 01:18:19,372
Yes, yes, you did.

1386
01:18:19,373 --> 01:18:24,813
I'm sorry for... for shooting
you that time. I'm really sorry.

1387
01:18:26,253 --> 01:18:28,892
- It's all right.
- I think we're even now, OK?

1388
01:18:28,893 --> 01:18:30,412
OK.

1389
01:18:30,413 --> 01:18:32,452
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...

1390
01:18:32,453 --> 01:18:35,493
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.

1391
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:41,010
You were my whole world.

1392
01:18:45,373 --> 01:18:48,093
Being Mary Watson...

1393
01:18:49,133 --> 01:18:53,532
...was the only life worth living.

1394
01:18:53,533 --> 01:18:55,290
- Mary...
- Thank you.

1395
01:18:58,533 --> 01:18:59,853
Mary...

1396
01:19:37,253 --> 01:19:39,373
Don't you dare!

1397
01:19:41,973 --> 01:19:43,893
You made a vow.

1398
01:19:46,973 --> 01:19:48,093
You swore it.

1399
01:21:15,533 --> 01:21:18,973
'You've been having
dreams. A recurring dream?'

1400
01:21:27,933 --> 01:21:29,533
Do you want to talk about it?

1401
01:21:39,013 --> 01:21:40,973
This is a two-way relationship, you know.

1402
01:21:51,613 --> 01:21:54,852
The whole world has come
crashing down around you.

1403
01:21:54,853 --> 01:21:56,812
Everything's hopeless.

1404
01:21:56,813 --> 01:21:57,853
Irretrievable.

1405
01:21:59,933 --> 01:22:01,813
I know that's what you must feel...

1406
01:22:03,053 --> 01:22:06,732
...but I can only help you if you
completely open yourself up to me.

1407
01:22:06,733 --> 01:22:08,733
That's not really my style.

1408
01:22:15,693 --> 01:22:17,093
I need to know what to do.

1409
01:22:18,933 --> 01:22:19,973
Do?

1410
01:22:21,293 --> 01:22:22,333
About John.

1411
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:13,893
Put me through to Sherrinford,
please. Yes, I'll wait.

1412
01:23:21,893 --> 01:23:24,212
But nothing will ever
be the same again, will it?

1413
01:23:24,213 --> 01:23:26,092
I'm afraid it won't.

1414
01:23:26,093 --> 01:23:29,412
We'll have to rally round,
I expect, do our bit.

1415
01:23:29,413 --> 01:23:31,253
Look after little Rosie.

1416
01:23:32,293 --> 01:23:33,453
I'm just going to, um...

1417
01:23:35,373 --> 01:23:37,932
...look through these things.
There might be a case.

1418
01:23:37,933 --> 01:23:41,853
A case? Oh, you're not up to it, are you?

1419
01:23:43,493 --> 01:23:46,252
Work is the best antidote
to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.

1420
01:23:46,253 --> 01:23:49,492
Yes. Yes, I expect you're right.

1421
01:23:49,493 --> 01:23:51,532
I'll make some tea, shall I?

1422
01:23:51,533 --> 01:23:53,213
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?

1423
01:23:56,013 --> 01:23:59,772
If you ever think I'm
becoming a bit full of myself,

1424
01:23:59,773 --> 01:24:02,652
cocky or over-confident...

1425
01:24:02,653 --> 01:24:04,250
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the

1426
01:24:04,275 --> 01:24:06,012
word Norbury to me? Would you?

1427
01:24:06,013 --> 01:24:07,932
Norbury?

1428
01:24:07,933 --> 01:24:08,973
Just that.

1429
01:24:10,973 --> 01:24:12,213
I'd be very grateful.

1430
01:24:17,293 --> 01:24:18,332
What's this?

1431
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:21,293
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.

1432
01:24:26,173 --> 01:24:28,092
Oh, God! Is that...?

1433
01:24:28,093 --> 01:24:29,853
- Must be.
- Oh.

1434
01:24:31,013 --> 01:24:32,972
I knew it wouldn't end like this.

1435
01:24:32,973 --> 01:24:35,493
I knew Moriarty made plans.

1436
01:24:38,133 --> 01:24:41,412
'I thought that would get your attention.

1437
01:24:41,413 --> 01:24:43,413
So, this is in case...

1438
01:24:46,173 --> 01:24:48,332
In case the day comes.

1439
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:52,613
If you are watching this,
I'm probably dead.

1440
01:24:53,733 --> 01:24:55,692
I hope I can have an
ordinary life but who knows?

1441
01:24:55,693 --> 01:24:58,812
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.

1442
01:24:58,813 --> 01:25:00,813
My old life...

1443
01:25:03,253 --> 01:25:05,013
...it was full of consequences.

1444
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:10,972
The danger was the fun part but
you can't outrun that forever.

1445
01:25:10,973 --> 01:25:13,693
You need to remember that. So...

1446
01:25:16,373 --> 01:25:20,413
...I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.

1447
01:25:22,613 --> 01:25:24,933
Might be the hardest case of your career.

1448
01:25:26,053 --> 01:25:29,973
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone...

1449
01:25:32,973 --> 01:25:34,853
...I need you to do something for me.'

1450
01:25:43,493 --> 01:25:46,133
Hi.

1451
01:25:47,653 --> 01:25:50,853
I just wondered how
things were going and...

1452
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:54,213
...if there was anything I could do.

1453
01:25:57,213 --> 01:25:59,613
It's, er, it's from John.

1454
01:26:00,853 --> 01:26:03,253
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.

1455
01:26:05,733 --> 01:26:07,052
I'm sorry, Sherlock.

1456
01:26:07,053 --> 01:26:12,692
He says... John said if you were
to come round asking after him,

1457
01:26:12,693 --> 01:26:13,853
offering to help...

1458
01:26:15,773 --> 01:26:17,572
Yes?

1459
01:26:17,573 --> 01:26:19,733
He said he'd...

1460
01:26:21,213 --> 01:26:23,333
...that he'd rather have anyone but you.

1461
01:26:25,253 --> 01:26:26,293
Anyone.

1462
01:26:41,133 --> 01:26:44,973
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.

1463
01:26:48,613 --> 01:26:52,293
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone...

1464
01:26:54,213 --> 01:26:56,613
...I need you to do something for me.

1465
01:26:59,933 --> 01:27:02,053
Save John Watson.

1466
01:27:04,893 --> 01:27:07,253
Save him, Sherlock.

1467
01:27:09,613 --> 01:27:10,973
Save him.'

1468
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:20,573
'When does the path we walk
on lock around our feet?

1469
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:28,733
When does the road become a
river with only one destination?'

1470
01:27:31,493 --> 01:27:35,852
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.

1471
01:27:35,853 --> 01:27:38,053
But can Samarra be avoided?'

1472
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:20,654
Go to hell, Sherlock!
