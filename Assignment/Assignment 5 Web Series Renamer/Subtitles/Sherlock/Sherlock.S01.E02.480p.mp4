1
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:17,521
The great artisans say
the more the teapot is used...

2
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,441
...the more beautiful
it becomes.

3
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:27,561
The pot is seasoned by repeatedly
pouring tea over the surface.

4
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:35,081
The deposit left on the clay
creates this beautiful patina over time.

5
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:41,641
Some pots, the clay has been burnished
by tea made over 400 years ago.

6
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:54,921
This museum will be closing
in 10 minutes. Please...

7
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:59,121
400 years old, they're letting you use it
to make yourself a brew.

8
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:03,921
Some things aren't supposed to sit
behind glass, they're made to be touched.

9
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:06,041
To be handled.

10
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:13,401
These pots need attention.
The clay is cracking.

11
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:16,761
Well, I can't see how
a tiny splash of tea is going to help.

12
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:19,681
Sometimes you have
to look hard at something...

13
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:21,561
...to see its value.

14
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:24,961
See?

15
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:28,241
This one shines
a little brighter.

16
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:31,721
I don't suppose.
Um, I mean...

17
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,681
I don't suppose
that you want to have a drink?

18
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,441
Not tea, obviously.
Um, in a pub, with me, tonight.

19
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:41,161
Um...?

20
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:44,641
You wouldn't like me
all that much.

21
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:48,241
Can I maybe
decide that for myself?

22
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:52,761
I can't.

23
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:55,121
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,401
Please stop asking.

25
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:25,321
Is that security?

26
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:44,521
Hello?

27
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,121
Can the till supervisor
please go to...?

28
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:59,441
Unexpected item in bagging area,
please try again.

29
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:11,401
- Item not scanned. Please try again.
- Can you maybe keep your voice down?

30
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:24,041
- Card not authorised
- Yes, all right!

31
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:28,561
Please use an alternative method
of payment. Card not authorised.

32
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:32,081
- Please use an alternative method..
- Keep it. Keep that.

33
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,561
- You took your time.
- Yeah, I didn't get the shopping.

34
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:57,721
What? Why not?

35
00:04:57,801 --> 00:05:01,321
Because I had a row in the shop
with a chip and PIN machine.

36
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,441
- You... You had a row with a machine?
- Sort of.

37
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,921
It sat there and I shouted abuse.
Have you got cash?

38
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,241
Take my card.

39
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:14,281
You could always go yourself, you know,
you've been sitting there all morning.

40
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:16,121
You've not even moved
since I left.

41
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:22,081
And what happened about that case
you were offered - the Jaria diamond?

42
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:23,721
Not interested.

43
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:28,001
I sent them a message.

44
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:43,801
Don't worry about me,
I can manage.

45
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,561
- Is that my computer?
- Of course.

46
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,361
- What?
- Mine was in the bedroom.

47
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:59,041
What? And you couldn't
be bothered to get up?

48
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:01,681
- It's password protected.
- In a manner of speaking.

49
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,561
Took me less than a minute to guess yours,
not exactly Fort Knox.

50
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,281
Right. Thank you.

51
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,321
Oh...

52
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,681
- Need to get a job.
- Oh, dull.

53
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,321
Listen, um...

54
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:34,121
...if you'd be able
to lend me some...

55
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:39,921
- Sherlock, are you listening?
- I need to go to the bank.

56
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:06,561
Yes, when you said
we were going to the bank...

57
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:28,001
Sherlock Holmes.

58
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:32,761
- Sherlock Holmes.
- Sebastian.

59
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:36,241
Hiya, buddy. How long - eight years
since I last clapped eyes on you?

60
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:39,001
- This is my friend, John Watson.
- Friend?

61
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:40,041
Colleague.

62
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,121
Right.

63
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,721
Grab a pew.

64
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:50,561
Do you need anything, coffee, water?
No? We're all sorted here, thanks.

65
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,881
So you're doing well.
You've been abroad a lot.

66
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,561
Well, so?

67
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:59,041
Flying all the way
around the world twice in a month.

68
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,201
Right.
You're doing that thing.

69
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:07,161
We were at uni together, and this
guy here had a trick he used to do.

70
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:08,401
It's not a trick.

71
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,481
He could look at you
and tell you your whole life story.

72
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:14,041
- Yes, I've seen him do it.
- Put the wind up everybody, we hated it.

73
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,841
We'd come down to breakfast
in the formal hall...

74
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:18,001
...and this freak would know
you'd been shagging the previous night.

75
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,561
- I simply observed.
- Go on, enlighten me.

76
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:24,401
Two trips a month, flying all the way
around the world, you're quite right.

77
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:27,761
How could you tell? Are you going
to tell me there's a stain on my tie...

78
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,441
...from some special kind of ketchup
you can only buy in Manhattan?

79
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,961
- No, I...
- Is it the mud on my shoes?

80
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,881
I was just chatting
with your secretary outside.

81
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:38,481
She told me.

82
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:47,361
I'm glad you could make it over,
we've had a break-in.

83
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:50,361
Sir William's office -
the bank's former chairman.

84
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:52,961
The room's been left here
like a sort of memorial.

85
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,401
Someone broke in
late last night.

86
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:58,081
- What did they steal?
- Nothing.

87
00:08:58,161 --> 00:09:00,441
Just left a little message.

88
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,841
60 seconds apart.

89
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:28,401
So, someone came up here
in the middle of the night...

90
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:31,161
...splashed paint around
and left within a minute.

91
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:32,961
How many ways
into that office?

92
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,281
Well, that's where this
gets really interesting.

93
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,961
Every door that opens in this bank,
it gets locked right here.

94
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:43,801
- Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet.
- That door didn't open last night?

95
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:48,841
There's a hole in our security.
Find it and we'll pay you - five figures.

96
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,281
This is an advance.
Tell me how he got in.

97
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:56,041
- There's a bigger one on its way.
- I don't need an incentive, Sebastian.

98
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:04,201
He's, er... he's kidding you, obviously.
Shall I look after that for him?

99
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:05,681
Thanks.

100
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,001
Two trips around the world
this month.

101
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:01,201
You didn't ask his secretary,
you said that just to irritate him.

102
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:02,921
- How did you know?
- Did you see his watch?

103
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:03,841
His watch?

104
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:05,921
The time was right,
but the date was wrong.

105
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:09,761
Said two days ago. Crossed the date line
twice and he didn't alter it.

106
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:14,521
- Within a month? How did you get that?
- New Breitling. Only came out this February.

107
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,841
OK. So do you think we should
sniff around here for a bit longer?

108
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:20,041
Got everything I need
to know already, thanks.

109
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:22,601
That graffiti
was a message.

110
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:25,041
Someone at the bank,
working on the trading floors.

111
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,281
We find the
intended recipient and...

112
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:30,121
- They'll lead us to the person who sent it?
- Obvious.

113
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:32,281
There's 300 people up there,
who was it meant for?

114
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:33,321
Pillars.

115
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:35,201
- What?
- Pillars and the screens.

116
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,401
Very few places
you could see that graffiti from.

117
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,481
That narrows the field considerably.
And, of course, the message was left...

118
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:43,401
...at 11.34 last night.
That tells us a lot.

119
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:45,121
- Does it?
- Traders come to work at all hours.

120
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:47,121
Some trade with Hong Kong
in the middle of the night.

121
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:50,721
That message was intended for
somebody who came in at midnight.

122
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:54,721
Not many Van Coons
in the phone book. Taxi!

123
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:19,161
So what do we do now?
Sit here and wait for him to come back?

124
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,081
- Just moved in.
- What?

125
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:25,081
- Floor above, new label.
- Could have just replaced it.

126
00:13:26,481 --> 00:13:28,481
No-one ever does that.

127
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:29,641
Hello?

128
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:34,441
Hi, um, I live in the flat just below you.
I don't think we've met.

129
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:37,321
No, well, er,
I've just moved in.

130
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,641
Actually, I've just locked
my keys in my flat.

131
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:45,521
- Do you want me to buzz you in?
- Yeah. And can we use your balcony?

132
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:47,041
What?

133
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:27,641
Sherlock?

134
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:31,321
Sherlock, are you OK?

135
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:39,401
Yeah, any time
you feel like letting me in.

136
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:57,961
Do you think he'd lost a lot of money?
Suicide is pretty common among City boys.

137
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,121
- We don't know that it was suicide.
- Come on.

138
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:03,281
The door was locked from the inside,
you had to climb down the balcony.

139
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:07,441
Been away three days
judging by the laundry.

140
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,681
Look at the case, there was something
tightly packed inside it.

141
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:14,561
- Thanks. I'll take your word for it.
- Problem?

142
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:18,921
Yeah, I'm not desperate to root around
some bloke's dirty underwear.

143
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,841
Those symbols at the bank,
the graffiti, why were they put there?

144
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,801
- Some sort of code?
- Obviously.

145
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,241
Why were they painted?
Want to communicate, why not use e-mail?

146
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:29,121
- Well, maybe he wasn't answering.
- Oh, good, you follow.

147
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:30,521
No.

148
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:33,881
What kind of a message
would everyone try to avoid?

149
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:37,001
What about this morning?

150
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:40,321
- Those letters you were looking at?
- Bills?

151
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:45,401
Yes.
He was being threatened.

152
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:50,241
- Not by the Gas Board.
- ...see if we can get prints off this glass.

153
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:53,921
- Sergeant, we haven't met.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

154
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:57,801
And I would prefer it if you didn't tamper
with any of the evidence.

155
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:05,121
- I phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way?
- He's busy. I'm in charge.

156
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:08,041
And it's not Sergeant,
it's Detective Inspector Dimmock.

157
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:14,801
We're obviously looking
at a suicide.

158
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:17,321
It does seem the only explanation
of all the facts.

159
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:20,201
Wrong, it's one possible explanation
of some of the facts.

160
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:22,321
You've got a solution that you like,
but you are choosing to ignore...

161
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,161
...anything you see
that doesn't comply with it.

162
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,881
- Like?
- Wound's on the right side of his head.

163
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:27,521
- And?
- Van Coon was left-handed.

164
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,041
- Requires quite a bit of contortion.
- Left-handed?

165
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:33,601
I'm amazed you didn't notice. All you
have to do is look around this flat.

166
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:36,641
Coffee table on the left-hand side,
coffee mug handle pointing to the left.

167
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:38,761
Power sockets, habitually used
the ones on the left.

168
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:41,641
Pen and paper on the left of the phone.
Picked up with his right...

169
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:42,881
...took messages
with his left.

170
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,281
- D'you want me to go on?
- No, I think you've covered it.

171
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,961
I might as well,
I'm almost at the bottom of the list.

172
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,561
There's a knife on the breadboard with
butter on the right side of the blade...

173
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,441
...because he used it with his left.
It's highly unlikely...

174
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:53,081
...that a left-handed man would shoot
himself in the right side of his head.

175
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,161
Conclusion, someone broke in here
and murdered him.

176
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:56,961
Only explanation
of all of the facts.

177
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,321
- But the gun?
- He was waiting for the killer.

178
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:02,201
- He'd been threatened.
- What?

179
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:05,201
Today at the bank,
sort of a warning.

180
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:07,041
He fired a shot
when his attacker came in.

181
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:09,681
- And the bullet?
- Went through the open window.

182
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,321
Oh, come on.

183
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:15,441
- What are the chances of that?
- Wait until you get the ballistics report.

184
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:18,721
The bullet in his brain wasn't fired
from his gun, I guarantee it.

185
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:22,401
But if his door was locked from the inside,
how did the killer get in?

186
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:25,441
Good, you're finally asking
the right questions.

187
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:34,641
He's left trying to sort of
cut his hair with a fork...

188
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,521
...which of course
can never be done.

189
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:39,401
It was a threat,
that's what the graffiti meant.

190
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:43,441
I'm kind of in a meeting. Can you make
an appointment with my secretary?

191
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,321
I don't think this can wait.
Sorry, Sebastian.

192
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:50,161
One of your traders, someone who worked
in your office, was killed.

193
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:51,921
- What?
- Van Coon.

194
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:54,161
- The police are at his flat.
- Killed?

195
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,881
Sorry to interfere with everyone's digestion.
Still want to make an appointment?

196
00:17:56,961 --> 00:18:00,481
Would maybe
nine o'clock at Scotland Yard suit?

197
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:08,001
Harrow, Oxford...
very bright guy.

198
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:14,641
- Worked in Asia for a while, so...
- You gave him the Hong Kong accounts?

199
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:20,001
Lost 5 million in a single morning,
made it all back a week later.

200
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:21,841
Nerves of steel,
Eddie had.

201
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:24,121
- Who'd want to kill him?
- We all make enemies.

202
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:26,641
You don't all end up with a bullet
through your temple.

203
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:28,481
Not usually. Excuse me.

204
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:33,881
It's my chairman.

205
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:37,681
Police have been on to him. Apparently
they're telling him it was a suicide.

206
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:40,561
Well they've got it wrong, Sebastian.
He was murdered.

207
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,721
Well, I'm afraid
they don't see it like that.

208
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,681
- So?
- And neither does my boss.

209
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:48,881
I hired you to do a job.
Don't get sidetracked.

210
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,841
I thought bankers were all supposed
to be heartless bastards.

211
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,881
I need you
to get over to Crispians.

212
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:49,201
Two Ming vases up for auction -
Chenghua.

213
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:53,881
- Will you appraise them?
- Soo Lin should go. She's the expert.

214
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,721
Soo Lin has resigned her job.
I need you.

215
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:53,201
- Just locum work.
- No, that's fine.

216
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:57,361
You're, um...
Well, you're a bit over-qualified.

217
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:01,441
Er, I could always do
with the money.

218
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:07,441
Well, we've got two away on holiday this
week and one's just left to have a baby.

219
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:14,041
- It might be a bit mundane for you.
- Er, no, mundane is good, sometimes.

220
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:15,601
Mundane works.

221
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:19,801
- It says here you were a soldier.
- And a doctor.

222
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,161
Anything else you can do?

223
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,201
I learned the clarinet
at school.

224
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:30,121
Oh... well,
I'll look forward to it.

225
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:41,321
I said,
could you pass me a pen?

226
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:44,881
- What? When?
- About an hour ago.

227
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:48,001
Didn't notice
I'd gone out then?

228
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:52,081
I went to see about a job
at that surgery.

229
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:54,921
- How was it?
- Great. She's great.

230
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:55,841
Who?

231
00:21:57,241 --> 00:21:59,201
- The job.
- She?

232
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:01,441
It.

233
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:04,721
Yeah, have a look.

234
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:14,081
- "The intruder who can walk through walls."
- It happened last night.

235
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:16,441
Journalist shot dead
in his flat.

236
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:20,001
Doors locked, windows bolted from the
inside. Exactly the same as Van Coon.

237
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:24,801
- God! You think...?
- He's killed another one.

238
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:34,281
Brian Lukis.

239
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:38,401
Freelance journalist,
murdered in his flat.

240
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:42,601
- Doors locked from the inside.
- You've got to admit, it's similar.

241
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:45,841
Both men killed by someone
who can walk through solid walls.

242
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:51,081
Inspector, do you seriously believe that Eddie
Van Coon was just another city suicide?

243
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:56,281
You have seen
the ballistics report, I suppose?

244
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:58,721
And the shot that killed him.
Was it fired from his own gun?

245
00:22:58,801 --> 00:22:59,561
- No.
- No.

246
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:03,761
So this investigation might move a bit quicker
if you were to take my word as gospel.

247
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:09,401
I've just handed you
a murder inquiry.

248
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:11,641
Five minutes in his flat.

249
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:41,081
Four floors up.

250
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:44,281
That's why they think
they're safe.

251
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:48,441
Put a chain across the door,
bolt it shut, think they're impregnable.

252
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:53,601
They don't reckon for one second
that there's another way in.

253
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:57,401
- I don't understand.
- Dealing with a killer who can climb.

254
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,721
- What are you doing?
- Clings to the walls like an insect.

255
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:04,841
- That's how he got in.
- What?

256
00:24:05,641 --> 00:24:08,521
He climbed up the side of the walls,
ran along the roof...

257
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:11,921
- ...dropped in through this skylight.
- You're not serious? Like Spider-Man?

258
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:14,841
He scaled six floors of a Docklands
apartment building...

259
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,481
- ...jumped the balcony and killed Van Coon.
- Oh, hold on.

260
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:21,561
That's how he got into the bank - ran
along the window ledge onto the terrace.

261
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:26,401
I have to find out
what connects these two men.

262
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:57,561
Date stamped on the book
is the same day that he died.

263
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:07,601
Sherlock?

264
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:22,041
So, the killer goes to the bank,
leaves a threatening cipher at the bank.

265
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:25,041
Van Coon panics, returns to
his apartment, locks himself in.

266
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:26,961
Hours later, he dies.

267
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:31,881
The killer finds Lukis at the library,
he writes the cipher on the shelf...

268
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:34,481
...where he knows it'll be seen.
Lukis goes home.

269
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,721
Late that night,
he dies too.

270
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:41,441
Why did they die,
Sherlock?

271
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:44,481
Only the cipher
can tell us.

272
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:52,721
The world's run on
codes and ciphers, John.

273
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,241
From the million-pound security system
at the bank to the PIN machine...

274
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:58,281
...you took exception to. Cryptography
inhabits our every waking moment.

275
00:25:58,361 --> 00:25:59,921
Yes, OK, but...

276
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:04,361
But it's all computer generated - electronic
codes, electronic ciphering methods.

277
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:08,081
This is different.
It's an ancient device.

278
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:10,161
Modern code-breaking methods
won't unravel it.

279
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:12,401
- Where are we headed?
- I need to ask some advice.

280
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:14,561
What? Sorry?

281
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:18,041
You heard me perfectly.
I'm not saying it again.

282
00:26:18,121 --> 00:26:20,001
- You need advice?
- On painting.

283
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:21,881
Yes, I need to talk
to an expert.

284
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,561
Part of a new exhibition.

285
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:35,441
- Interesting.
- I call it...

286
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,721
Urban Bloodlust Frenzy.

287
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:40,481
Catchy.

288
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:44,881
I've got two minutes before a Community
Support Officer comes around that corner.

289
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:48,121
Can we do this
while I'm working?

290
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,441
Know the author?

291
00:26:54,921 --> 00:26:56,921
I recognise the paint.

292
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:59,401
It's like Michigan
hard-core propellant.

293
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:00,641
I'd say zinc.

294
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:03,161
And what about the symbols?
Do you recognise them?

295
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:06,401
I'm not even sure
it's a proper language.

296
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:08,121
Two men have
been murdered, Raz.

297
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:10,721
Deciphering this is the key
to finding out who killed them.

298
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:14,881
And this is all you've got to go on?
It's hardly much, is it?

299
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:16,521
Are you going
to help us or not?

300
00:27:17,921 --> 00:27:20,881
- I'll ask around.
- Somebody must know something about it.

301
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:21,641
Oi!

302
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,481
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This gallery is a listed public building.

303
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:29,441
No, no. Wait, wait.
It's not me who painted that.

304
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:31,601
I was just holding this for...

305
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:39,521
Bit of an enthusiast,
are we?

306
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:45,801
She was right in the middle of
an important piece of restoration.

307
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:49,761
- Why would she suddenly resign?
- Family problems. She said so in her letter.

308
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:52,681
But she doesn't have a family.
She came to this country on her own.

309
00:27:52,761 --> 00:27:53,521
Andy!

310
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:57,401
Look, those teapots, those ceramics.
They've become her obsession.

311
00:27:57,481 --> 00:27:59,401
She's been working on
restoring them for weeks.

312
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:02,321
I can't believe
that she would just abandon them.

313
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,561
Perhaps she was getting a bit of
unwanted attention?

314
00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:19,961
You've been a while.

315
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:24,481
Yeah, well,
you know how it is.

316
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:27,161
Custody sergeants don't really
like to be hurried, do they?

317
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:28,961
Just formalities.

318
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,441
Fingerprints, charge sheet, and I've got
to be in magistrates' court on Tuesday.

319
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:36,321
- What?
- Me, Sherlock! In court, on Tuesday!

320
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:39,161
- They're giving me an ASBO!
- Good, fine.

321
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:42,121
You want to tell your little pal
he's welcome to go and own up any time.

322
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:44,681
This symbol,
I still can't place it.

323
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:47,641
No, I need you to go to the police station
and ask about the journalist.

324
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:49,721
The personal effects
will have been impounded.

325
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:53,081
Get hold of his diary, or something
that will tell us his movements.

326
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:55,241
Go and see Van Coon's PA.

327
00:28:55,321 --> 00:28:59,081
If you retrace their steps,
somewhere they'll coincide.

328
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:08,361
Scotland Yard.

329
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:20,761
Flew back
from Dalian Friday.

330
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:23,161
Looks like he had back-to-back meetings
with the sales team.

331
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:26,081
- Can you print me up a copy?
- Sure.

332
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:28,321
What about the day he died?
Can you tell me where he was?

333
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:30,241
Sorry, I've got a gap.

334
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:33,041
I have all his receipts.

335
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:35,721
- Your friend...
- Listen, whatever you say...

336
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:37,681
...I'm behind you
100 per cent.

337
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:39,161
He's an arrogant sod.

338
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:44,321
Well, that was mild.
People say a lot worse than that.

339
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:48,841
This is what you wanted, isn't it?
The journalist's diary?

340
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:57,001
What kind of a boss was he, Amanda?
Appreciative?

341
00:29:57,081 --> 00:30:00,161
Um, no.
That's not a word I'd use.

342
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:04,361
The only things Eddie appreciated
had a big price tag.

343
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:07,801
Like that hand cream.
He bought that for you, didn't he?

344
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,241
Look at this one.

345
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:17,561
Got a taxi from him
on the day he died, £18.50.

346
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:19,441
That would get him
to the office.

347
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:22,481
Not rush hour. Check the time.
Mid-morning. 18 would get him as far as...

348
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:25,521
The West End.
I remember him saying.

349
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:28,601
Underground,
printed at one in Piccadilly.

350
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:31,641
So he got a Tube
back to the office.

351
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:33,921
Why would he get a taxi into town
and then the Tube back?

352
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:38,121
Because he was delivering something heavy.
You wouldn't lug a package up the escalator.

353
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:42,081
- Delivering?
- To somewhere near Piccadilly Station.

354
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:45,441
Dropped the package,
delivered it, and then...

355
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:49,881
Stopped on his way.
He got peckish.

356
00:30:52,441 --> 00:30:55,961
So you bought your lunch
from here en route to the station.

357
00:30:56,041 --> 00:31:00,321
But where were you headed from?
Where did the taxi drop you?

358
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,521
Right.

359
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,721
Eddie Van Coon brought
a package here the day he died.

360
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:06,361
Whatever was hidden inside that case
I've managed to piece together a picture...

361
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:09,281
...using scraps of information -
credit card bills, receipts.

362
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:10,881
He flew back from China,
then he came here.

363
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:13,041
- Sherlock.
- Somewhere in this street, somewhere near.

364
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,561
- I don't know where, but...
- That shop, over there.

365
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,481
- How could you tell?
- Lukis's diary. He was here too.

366
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:22,641
- He wrote down the address.
- Oh.

367
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:48,801
Hello.

368
00:31:54,921 --> 00:31:57,441
You want... lucky cat?

369
00:31:58,121 --> 00:32:00,081
No, thanks, no.

370
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:02,761
£10! £10!

371
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:07,081
I think your wife,
she will like.

372
00:32:07,401 --> 00:32:08,761
Um, maybe...

373
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:18,321
Sherlock...

374
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:23,321
- The label there.
- Yes, I see it.

375
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:25,761
It's exactly the same
as the cipher.

376
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:34,761
It's an ancient number system -
Hang Zhou.

377
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:37,081
These days only
street traders use it.

378
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:40,361
Those were numbers written on the wall
at the bank, and at the library.

379
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:43,401
Numbers written in
an ancient Chinese dialect.

380
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:44,881
It's a 15.

381
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:47,721
What we thought was the artist's tag,
it's a number 15.

382
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:51,201
And the blindfold, the horizontal line.
That was a number as well.

383
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:54,121
- The Chinese number one, John.
- We found it.

384
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:02,001
Two men travel back
from China...

385
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:06,761
...both head straight for
the Lucky Cat emporium.

386
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:09,121
What did they see?

387
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,601
It's not what they saw.

388
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:14,761
It's what they both brought back
in those suitcases.

389
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:17,601
And you don't mean
duty free.

390
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:19,601
Thank you.

391
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:25,441
Think about
what Sebastian told us.

392
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:28,361
About Van Coon, about how
he stayed afloat in the market.

393
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:31,361
- Lost 5 million.
- Made it back in a week.

394
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:33,121
That's how he made
such easy money.

395
00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:37,681
- He was a smuggler.
- Cover would have been perfect.

396
00:33:39,161 --> 00:33:41,521
Businessman,
making frequent trips to Asia.

397
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:45,281
Lukis was the same,
a journalist writing about China.

398
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:47,601
Both of them
smuggled stuff about.

399
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:49,841
The Lucky Cat
was their drop-off.

400
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:53,201
But why did they die?
It doesn't make sense.

401
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,361
If they both turn up at the shop
and deliver the goods...

402
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:58,961
...why would someone threaten them
and kill them after the event.

403
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,361
After they'd finished the job?

404
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:06,761
What if one of them
was light-fingered?

405
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:10,041
- How do you mean?
- Stole something. Something from the hoard.

406
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:13,721
The killer doesn't know which of them
took it, so threatens them both. Right.

407
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:18,321
Remind me.

408
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:20,961
When was the last time
that it rained?

409
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,521
It's been here since Monday.

410
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:46,561
No-one's been in that flat
for at least three days.

411
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:48,721
Could have gone on holiday.

412
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,521
Do you leave your windows open
when you go on holiday?

413
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:02,401
Sherlock!

414
00:35:10,801 --> 00:35:12,401
Someone else
has been here.

415
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:17,161
Somebody else broke into the flat
and knocked over the vase, just like I did.

416
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:30,761
Do you think maybe
you could let me in this time?

417
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:37,401
Can you not
keep doing this, please?

418
00:35:43,961 --> 00:35:45,521
I'm not the first.

419
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:50,521
- What?
- Somebody's been in here before me.

420
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:53,161
What are you saying?

421
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:57,441
Size eight feet.

422
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:00,401
Small, but...

423
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:03,041
...athletic.

424
00:36:03,881 --> 00:36:05,881
I'm wasting my breath.

425
00:36:09,641 --> 00:36:12,241
Small, strong hands.

426
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:16,281
Our acrobat.

427
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:20,001
Why didn't he close the window
when he lef...?

428
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:22,641
Oh, stupid, stupid!

429
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:24,401
Obvious.

430
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,521
He's still here.

431
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:51,921
Any time you want
to include me...

432
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,241
John...

433
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,641
John!

434
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,441
Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone...

435
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:02,721
...because no-one else can compete
with my massive intellect.

436
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:47,281
The milk's gone off
and the washing's started to smell.

437
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:49,241
Somebody left here in a hurry
three days ago.

438
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:50,441
Somebody?

439
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:53,841
Soo Lin Yao.
We have to find her.

440
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,441
How, exactly?

441
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:03,361
- We could start with this.
- You've gone all croaky.

442
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:06,521
- Are you getting a cold?
- I'm fine.

443
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:12,641
- When was the last time that you saw her?
- Three days ago. Here at the museum.

444
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:19,321
This morning they told me she'd resigned.
Just like that. Left her work unfinished.

445
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:24,001
What was the last thing that she did
on her final afternoon?

446
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:33,361
She does this demonstration
for the tourists, a tea ceremony.

447
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:38,721
So she would have packed up her things
and just put them in here.

448
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:59,281
- We have to get to Soo Lin Yao.
- If she's still alive.

449
00:38:59,361 --> 00:39:02,241
- Sherlock!
- Oh, look who it is.

450
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:04,521
Found something you'll like.

451
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:14,441
Tuesday morning, all you've got to do
is turn up and say the bag was yours.

452
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,641
Forget about
your court date.

453
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:24,361
Dude, that was rad!

454
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:30,281
You want to hide a tree, then a forest is
the best place to do it, wouldn't you say?

455
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:35,481
People would just walk straight past, not
knowing, unable to decipher the message.

456
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:39,001
There.
I spotted it earlier.

457
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:42,681
They've been here.
And that's the exact same paint?

458
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:43,801
Yeah.

459
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,841
John, if we're going to decipher this code,
we need to look for more evidence.

460
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:52,321
Answer your phone.
I've been calling you.

461
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,721
I found it.

462
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:10,921
It's been painted over.

463
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:17,001
I don't understand.
It was... here.

464
00:41:19,081 --> 00:41:22,481
10 minutes ago. I saw it.
A whole load of graffiti.

465
00:41:22,561 --> 00:41:25,121
Somebody doesn't want me
to see it.

466
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:28,521
- Hey! Sherlock, what are you doing...?
- John, concentrate.

467
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:33,081
- I need you to concentrate. Close your eyes.
- What? Why? Why? What are you doing?

468
00:41:33,881 --> 00:41:37,521
I need you to maximise your visual memory.
Try to picture what you saw.

469
00:41:37,601 --> 00:41:39,801
- Can you picture it?
- Yeah.

470
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:41,681
- Can you remember it?
- Yes, definitely.

471
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:43,041
- Can you remember the pattern?
- Yes.

472
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:44,961
- How much can you remember it?
- Look, don't worry.

473
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:48,881
Because the average human memory
on visual matters is only 62% accurate.

474
00:41:48,961 --> 00:41:50,921
- Well, don't worry, I remember all of it.
- Really?

475
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:54,001
Well at least I would,
if I could get to my pockets.

476
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:55,801
I took a photograph.

477
00:42:16,441 --> 00:42:18,921
Always in pairs,
John, look.

478
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:21,401
Numbers...

479
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:24,761
- ...come with partners.
- God, I need to sleep.

480
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:27,841
- Why did he paint it so near the tracks?
- No idea.

481
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,881
Thousands of people
pass by there every day.

482
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:31,961
Just 20 minutes...

483
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,281
Of course.

484
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:36,161
Of course,
he wants information.

485
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:38,721
He's trying to communicate
with his people in the underworld.

486
00:42:38,801 --> 00:42:41,361
Whatever was stolen,
he wants it back.

487
00:42:41,761 --> 00:42:44,561
It's somewhere here,
in a code.

488
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:48,481
We can't crack this
without Soo Lin Yao.

489
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:50,001
Oh, good.

490
00:42:50,521 --> 00:42:53,121
Two men who travelled back
from China were murdered.

491
00:42:53,201 --> 00:42:56,081
And their killer left them messages
in Hang Zhou numerals.

492
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:58,321
Soo Lin Yao is in danger.

493
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:01,001
That cipher, it was just
the same pattern as the others.

494
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:02,881
He means
to kill her as well.

495
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:05,881
Look, I've tried everywhere -
friends, colleagues.

496
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:10,401
I don't know where she's gone.
I mean, she could be a thousand miles away.

497
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:14,681
- What are you looking at?
- Tell me more about those teapots.

498
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:18,961
The pots were her obsession.
They need urgent work.

499
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:21,721
If they dry out,
then the clay can start to crumble.

500
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:24,841
Apparently, you have to just
keep making tea in them.

501
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:28,441
Yesterday, only one
of those pots was shining.

502
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:30,761
Now, there are two.

503
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:23,161
Fancy a biscuit with that?

504
00:44:25,321 --> 00:44:28,561
Centuries old.
Don't want to break that.

505
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:36,601
Hello.

506
00:44:37,361 --> 00:44:38,881
You saw the cipher.

507
00:44:39,921 --> 00:44:42,521
Then you know
he is coming for me.

508
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:45,641
You've been clever
to avoid him so far.

509
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:47,921
I had to finish.

510
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,201
To finish this work.

511
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:54,361
It's only a matter of time.

512
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,681
I know he will find me.

513
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:59,641
Who is he?
Have you met him before?

514
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:04,921
When I was a girl,
we met in China.

515
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:08,521
I recognised his...

516
00:45:09,401 --> 00:45:11,641
- ...signature.
- The cipher?

517
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:15,681
Only he would do this.

518
00:45:16,641 --> 00:45:17,801
Zhi Zhu.

519
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:21,401
- Zhi Zhu?
- The spider.

520
00:45:26,721 --> 00:45:31,041
- You know this mark?
- Yes. It's the mark of a Tong.

521
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:34,721
Ancient crime syndicate,
based in China.

522
00:45:37,881 --> 00:45:40,841
Every foot soldier
bears the mark.

523
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:44,001
Everyone who hauls for them.

524
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:45,961
Hauls?

525
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:50,481
You mean
you were a smuggler?

526
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:56,001
I was 15.

527
00:45:58,281 --> 00:46:00,081
My parents were dead.

528
00:46:01,121 --> 00:46:03,121
I had no livelihood.

529
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,241
No way of surviving,
day-to-day...

530
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:09,841
...except to work
for the bosses.

531
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:11,601
Who are they?

532
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,681
They are called
the Black Lotus.

533
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:21,121
By the time I was 16...

534
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:26,001
...I was taking thousands
of pounds worth of drugs...

535
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:28,121
...across the border
into Hong Kong.

536
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:35,001
I managed to leave
that life behind me.

537
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:38,761
I came to England.

538
00:46:40,641 --> 00:46:42,921
They gave me a job,
here.

539
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,761
Everything was good.

540
00:46:48,641 --> 00:46:49,481
New life.

541
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:52,321
And he came looking for you.

542
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:54,121
Yes.

543
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:59,201
I hoped,
after five years...

544
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:02,161
...maybe they would have
forgotten me.

545
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:06,121
But they never really
let you leave.

546
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:11,041
A small community like ours...

547
00:47:12,281 --> 00:47:14,881
...they are never
very far away.

548
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:22,321
He came to my flat.

549
00:47:22,401 --> 00:47:26,841
He asked me to help him to track down
something that was stolen.

550
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:28,761
And you've no idea
what it was?

551
00:47:29,361 --> 00:47:31,081
I refused to help.

552
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:35,441
So, you knew him well
when you were living back in China?

553
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,721
Oh, yes.

554
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:42,801
He's my brother.

555
00:47:57,081 --> 00:47:58,521
Two orphans.

556
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:02,721
We had no choice.

557
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:10,801
We could work for the Black Lotus,
or starve on the streets, like beggars.

558
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:18,081
My brother has become
their puppet.

559
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:22,281
In the power of the one
they call Shan.

560
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,801
The Black Lotus general.

561
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:31,041
I turned my brother away.

562
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:35,281
He said
I had betrayed him.

563
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:39,881
Next day,
I came to work...

564
00:48:40,201 --> 00:48:42,521
...and the cipher
was waiting.

565
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:51,401
Can you decipher these?

566
00:48:52,081 --> 00:48:54,041
- These are numbers.
- Yes, I know.

567
00:48:55,441 --> 00:49:00,081
Here, the line across the man's eyes,
it's the Chinese number one.

568
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:03,241
And this one is 15.
But what's the code?

569
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:06,921
All the smugglers know it.

570
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:08,321
It's based upon a book...

571
00:49:13,561 --> 00:49:15,041
He's here.

572
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:17,121
Zhi Zhu...

573
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:19,481
...has found me.

574
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:22,841
No, no, Sherlock.
Sherlock, wait!

575
00:49:23,721 --> 00:49:26,601
Come here.
Get in. Get in!

576
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:45,241
I have to go and help him.
Bolt the door after me.

577
00:50:16,761 --> 00:50:18,121
Careful!

578
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:21,441
Some of those skulls
are over 200,000 years old.

579
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:23,681
Have a bit of respect.

580
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:27,241
Thank you.

581
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:26,721
Liang.

582
00:51:43,121 --> 00:51:44,681
Oh, my God.

583
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:19,561
How many murders is it going to take
before you start believing...

584
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:21,961
...that this maniac's out there?

585
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:25,481
A young girl
was gunned down tonight.

586
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:29,401
That's three victims in three days.
You're supposed to be finding him.

587
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:33,121
Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon were working
for a gang of international smugglers.

588
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:36,681
A gang called the Black Lotus,
operating here in London...

589
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:38,961
...right under your nose.

590
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:40,401
Can you prove that?

591
00:52:47,921 --> 00:52:51,001
- What are you thinking? Pork or pasta?
- Oh, it's you.

592
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:56,521
I suppose it's never going to trouble Egon
Ronay, is it? I'd stick with the pasta.

593
00:52:57,041 --> 00:53:00,841
Don't want to be doing roast pork,
not if you're slicing up cadavers.

594
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:03,121
What are you having?

595
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:06,161
I don't eat when I'm working.
Digesting slows me down.

596
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:08,081
So you're working
here tonight?

597
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:10,441
- Need to examine some bodies.
- Some?

598
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:13,241
Eddie Van Coon
and Brian Lukis.

599
00:53:13,321 --> 00:53:14,761
They're on my list.

600
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,561
Could you wheel them out
again for me?

601
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:22,841
Well... their paperwork's
already gone through.

602
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:29,601
- You changed your hair.
- What?

603
00:53:29,681 --> 00:53:32,201
The style.
It's usually parted in the middle.

604
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:37,481
- Yes, well...
- It's good. It... suits you better this way.

605
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:50,241
We're just interested
in the feet.

606
00:53:50,321 --> 00:53:51,641
- The feet?
- Yes.

607
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:54,001
Do you mind
if we have a look at them?

608
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:03,161
Now, Van Coon.

609
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:10,121
Oh!

610
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:12,321
So...

611
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:15,441
So either these two men just happened
to visit the same Chinese tattoo parlour...

612
00:54:15,521 --> 00:54:16,881
...or I'm telling the truth.

613
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:18,801
What do you want?

614
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,721
I want every book from Lukis's apartment
and Van Coon's.

615
00:54:22,121 --> 00:54:24,001
Their books?

616
00:54:27,161 --> 00:54:30,921
Not just a criminal organisation.
It's a cult.

617
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:35,361
Her brother was corrupted
by one of its leaders.

618
00:54:35,441 --> 00:54:38,881
- Soo Lin said the name.
- Yes, Shan.

619
00:54:38,961 --> 00:54:41,081
- General Shan.
- We're still no closer to finding him.

620
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:43,521
Wrong! We've got almost
all we need to know.

621
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:47,081
She gave us most
of the missing pieces.

622
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:49,121
Why did he need
to visit his sister?

623
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:51,641
- Why did he need her expertise?
- She worked at the museum.

624
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,601
- Exactly.
- An expert in antiquities.

625
00:54:55,401 --> 00:54:57,441
- Of course, I see.
- Valuable antiquities, John.

626
00:54:57,521 --> 00:55:00,481
Ancient Chinese relics
purchased on the black market.

627
00:55:00,561 --> 00:55:03,641
China's home to a thousand treasures
hidden after Mao's revolution.

628
00:55:03,721 --> 00:55:06,081
The Black Lotus
is selling them.

629
00:55:10,521 --> 00:55:12,601
Check for the dates...
Here!

630
00:55:12,681 --> 00:55:15,281
John, "arrived from China
four days ago".

631
00:55:16,241 --> 00:55:17,761
Anonymous.

632
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:20,361
The vendor
doesn't give his name.

633
00:55:20,441 --> 00:55:22,841
"Two undiscovered treasures
from the East."

634
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:26,921
One in Lukis's suitcase
and one in Van Coon's.

635
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:28,441
Antiquities...

636
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:31,601
...sold at auction.

637
00:55:32,681 --> 00:55:34,441
Look, here's another one.

638
00:55:34,521 --> 00:55:39,761
Arrived from China a month ago,
Chinese ceramic statue sold for £400,000.

639
00:55:40,281 --> 00:55:43,321
Look, a month before that,
Chinese painting, £500,000.

640
00:55:43,401 --> 00:55:45,801
All of them from
an anonymous source.

641
00:55:45,881 --> 00:55:49,761
They're stealing them back in China
and one by one feeding them into Britain.

642
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:57,161
Every single auction coincides with
Lukis or Van Coon travelling to China.

643
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:59,161
So what if one of them got greedy
when they were in China?

644
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:03,241
- What if one of them stole something?
- That's why Zhi Zhu's come.

645
00:56:03,321 --> 00:56:06,281
Sorry, are we collecting for charity,
Sherlock?

646
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:10,481
- What?
- A young man's outside with crates of books.

647
00:56:16,161 --> 00:56:18,041
So the numbers
are references.

648
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:19,561
To books.

649
00:56:19,641 --> 00:56:22,801
To specific pages
and specific words on those pages.

650
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:24,881
Right, so...

651
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,001
15 and 1, that means?

652
00:56:27,081 --> 00:56:29,081
Turn to page 15
and it's the first word you read.

653
00:56:29,161 --> 00:56:31,961
- OK, so what's the message?
- Depends on the book.

654
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:34,761
That's the cunning
of the book code.

655
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:36,681
It has to be one
that they both own.

656
00:56:39,841 --> 00:56:44,521
OK, fine... This shouldn't
take too long, should it?

657
00:56:57,001 --> 00:57:01,241
We found these... at the museum.
Is this your writing?

658
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:04,801
Er, we hoped Soo Lin
could decipher it for us.

659
00:57:04,881 --> 00:57:06,241
Ta.

660
00:57:07,401 --> 00:57:09,361
Anything else I can do?

661
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:11,401
To assist you,
I mean.

662
00:57:11,481 --> 00:57:13,881
Some silence right now
would be marvellous.

663
00:57:28,641 --> 00:57:30,041
Cigarette.

664
00:57:58,681 --> 00:58:00,041
Imagine.

665
00:58:14,481 --> 00:58:15,841
Oh...

666
00:58:20,881 --> 00:58:22,321
I'm sorry
to keep you waiting...

667
00:58:22,401 --> 00:58:26,161
...but we haven't got anything now
until next Thursday.

668
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:28,361
This is taking ages.

669
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:30,401
Sorry.

670
00:58:30,481 --> 00:58:33,681
What's the point of booking
an appointment if they can't stick to it?

671
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:35,281
Um, what's going on?

672
00:58:36,201 --> 00:58:40,481
That new doctor you hired,
he hasn't buzzed the intercom for ages.

673
00:58:41,241 --> 00:58:43,081
- Let me go and have a word.
- Yeah.

674
00:58:43,161 --> 00:58:45,521
- Excuse me.
- Sorry...

675
00:58:46,881 --> 00:58:48,321
John?

676
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:52,641
John?

677
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:07,201
Looks like I'm done.
I thought I had some more to see.

678
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:10,321
- Oh, I did one or two of yours.
- One or two?

679
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:13,241
Well, maybe five or six.

680
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:18,761
- I'm sorry, that's not very professional.
- No, not really.

681
00:59:18,841 --> 00:59:21,121
I had...
a bit of a late one.

682
00:59:22,481 --> 00:59:24,001
Oh, right.

683
00:59:26,201 --> 00:59:27,201
Anyway, see you.

684
00:59:27,681 --> 00:59:31,881
So... what were you doing
to keep you up so late?

685
00:59:31,961 --> 00:59:35,121
I was attending
a sort of book event.

686
00:59:35,201 --> 00:59:39,201
Oh. Oh, she likes books,
does she, your girlfriend?

687
00:59:39,961 --> 00:59:43,241
- No, it wasn't a date.
- Good. I mean, I'm...

688
00:59:43,321 --> 00:59:45,121
And I don't have
one tonight.

689
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:50,841
A book that
everybody would own.

690
01:00:00,241 --> 01:00:02,601
15, entry 1.

691
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:18,161
I need to get some air.
We're going out tonight.

692
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:21,041
- Actually, I've got a date.
- What?

693
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:24,121
Where two people who like each other
go out and have fun?

694
01:00:24,201 --> 01:00:28,041
- That's what I was suggesting.
- No, it wasn't. At least, I hope not.

695
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:31,281
- Where are you taking her?
- Er, cinema.

696
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,721
Dull, boring, predictable...

697
01:00:34,201 --> 01:00:35,721
Why don't you try this?

698
01:00:35,801 --> 01:00:38,441
In London
for one night only.

699
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:42,081
Thanks, but I don't come to you
for dating advice.

700
01:00:42,161 --> 01:00:45,121
It's years since anyone
took me to the circus.

701
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:46,601
Right, yes.

702
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:51,241
A friend recommended it to me
and I phoned up.

703
01:00:51,321 --> 01:00:53,201
Oh! What are they,
a touring company or something?

704
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:55,481
I don't know much
about it.

705
01:00:56,001 --> 01:01:01,681
- I think they're probably from China.
- I think so, yes. There's a coincidence.

706
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:04,801
That's wonderful,
thank you very much.

707
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:07,521
Hi, I have two tickets
reserved for tonight.

708
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:10,321
- And what's the name?
- Holmes.

709
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:16,121
Actually,
I have three in that name.

710
01:01:16,201 --> 01:01:18,561
No, I don't think so,
we only booked two.

711
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:21,841
Then I phoned back
and got one for myself as well.

712
01:01:22,481 --> 01:01:24,081
I'm Sherlock.

713
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:28,521
- Hi.
- Hello.

714
01:01:32,161 --> 01:01:34,201
You couldn't let me have
just one night off.

715
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:38,001
Yellow Dragon Circus,
in London for one day. It fits.

716
01:01:38,081 --> 01:01:40,801
- The Tong sent an assassin to England...
- Dressed as a tightrope walker.

717
01:01:40,881 --> 01:01:41,761
Come on, Sherlock,
behave!

718
01:01:41,841 --> 01:01:43,681
We're looking for a killer
who can climb, who can shin up a rope.

719
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:46,481
Where else would you find
that level of dexterity?

720
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:48,801
Exit visas
are scarce in China.

721
01:01:48,881 --> 01:01:50,721
They need a good reason
to get out of that country.

722
01:01:50,801 --> 01:01:52,401
All I need to do
is have a quick look around...

723
01:01:52,481 --> 01:01:55,681
- Fine. You do that, I'll take Sarah for a pint.
- I need your help.

724
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:57,641
I do have a couple of other things
on my mind this evening.

725
01:01:57,721 --> 01:01:58,521
Like what?

726
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:00,961
You are kidding?

727
01:02:01,841 --> 01:02:04,241
- What's so important?
- Sherlock, I'm in the middle of a date.

728
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:06,601
You're going to chase some killer
while I'm trying to...

729
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:08,241
What?

730
01:02:08,321 --> 01:02:10,841
While I'm trying
to get off with Sarah.

731
01:02:10,921 --> 01:02:12,441
Hey...

732
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:14,201
- Ready?
- Yeah.

733
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:28,481
You said circus. This is not a circus.
Look at the size of this crowd.

734
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:31,041
Sherlock, this is... art.

735
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:33,481
This is not their day job.

736
01:02:33,561 --> 01:02:37,761
Sorry, I forgot, they're not a circus,
they're a gang of international smugglers.

737
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:14,041
Classic Chinese escapology act.

738
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,881
The crossbow's on
a delicate string.

739
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:20,001
The warrior has to escape his bonds
before it fires.

740
01:04:40,841 --> 01:04:42,201
Oh!

741
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:58,001
She splits the sandbag,
the sand pours out.

742
01:04:58,081 --> 01:05:00,721
Gradually, the weight
lowers into the bowl.

743
01:05:40,161 --> 01:05:42,241
- Thank God.
- My God!

744
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:15,921
Ladies and gentlemen.

745
01:06:16,441 --> 01:06:21,041
From the distant moonlit shores
of the Yangtze River...

746
01:06:21,121 --> 01:06:28,161
...we present, for your pleasure,
the deadly Chinese bird spider.

747
01:06:37,521 --> 01:06:39,241
Did you see that?

748
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,161
Well, well.

749
01:07:32,561 --> 01:07:34,121
Found you.

750
01:08:39,481 --> 01:08:42,441
- Come on.
- Come on. Let's go!

751
01:08:42,521 --> 01:08:46,201
I sent a couple of cars.
The old hall is totally deserted.

752
01:08:46,281 --> 01:08:48,561
Look, I saw the mark
at the circus.

753
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:51,521
The tattoo that we saw on the two bodies,
the mark of the Tong.

754
01:08:51,601 --> 01:08:54,681
Lukis and Van Coon were part
of a smuggling operation.

755
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:57,241
One of them stole something when
they were in China. Something valuable.

756
01:08:57,321 --> 01:08:59,761
The circus performers were gang members
sent here to get it back.

757
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:00,961
Get what back?

758
01:09:02,521 --> 01:09:03,801
We don't know.

759
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:05,561
You don't know?

760
01:09:07,121 --> 01:09:10,321
Mr Holmes,
I've done everything you asked.

761
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:13,361
Lestrade, he seems to think
your advice is worth something.

762
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,161
I gave the order
for a raid.

763
01:09:15,241 --> 01:09:17,241
Please tell me I'll have something
to show for it.

764
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:20,641
Other than a massive bill
for overtime.

765
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:26,561
They'll be back in China
by tomorrow.

766
01:09:26,641 --> 01:09:29,761
No, they won't leave
without what they came for.

767
01:09:29,841 --> 01:09:33,441
We need to find a hideout.
A rendezvous.

768
01:09:34,201 --> 01:09:37,921
Somewhere in this message
it must tell us.

769
01:09:41,801 --> 01:09:43,881
Well, I think
perhaps I should leave you to it.

770
01:09:43,961 --> 01:09:46,481
- No, you don't have to go. Stay.
- Yes, it'd be better if you left now.

771
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:49,921
He's kidding.
Please stay if you'd like.

772
01:09:51,121 --> 01:09:55,281
- Is it just me or is anyone else starving?
- Oh, God.

773
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:09,921
So this is what you do.

774
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:12,681
You and John,
you solve puzzles for a living.

775
01:10:13,361 --> 01:10:15,081
Consulting detective.

776
01:10:16,081 --> 01:10:17,201
Oh.

777
01:10:18,401 --> 01:10:19,761
Oh!

778
01:10:22,921 --> 01:10:26,481
- What are these squiggles?
- They're numbers.

779
01:10:26,561 --> 01:10:28,081
An ancient Chinese dialect.

780
01:10:28,841 --> 01:10:32,441
Oh, right. Well, of course
I should have known that.

781
01:10:37,481 --> 01:10:41,161
I've done punch
and a bowl of nibbles.

782
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:43,041
Mrs Hudson,
you are a saint.

783
01:10:43,121 --> 01:10:45,081
If it was Monday,
I'd have been to the supermarket.

784
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:47,161
Thank you. Thank you.

785
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:56,841
- So these numbers, it's a cipher?
- Exactly.

786
01:10:56,921 --> 01:10:59,361
And each pair of numbers
is a word?

787
01:11:00,241 --> 01:11:01,521
How did you know that?

788
01:11:01,601 --> 01:11:04,281
Well, two words
have already been translated. Here.

789
01:11:06,881 --> 01:11:08,241
John.

790
01:11:09,321 --> 01:11:11,121
John, look at this.

791
01:11:11,961 --> 01:11:15,041
Soo Lin at the museum,
she started to translate the code for us.

792
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:16,841
We didn't see it.

793
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:19,121
Nine mill.

794
01:11:21,401 --> 01:11:25,721
- Does that mean millions?
- Nine million quid. For what?

795
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:29,641
- We need to know the end of this sentence.
- Where are you going?

796
01:11:29,721 --> 01:11:33,641
To the museum, to the restoration room.
We must have been staring right at it.

797
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:35,681
- At what?
- The book, John. The book.

798
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:38,321
The key to cracking the cipher.
Soo Lin used it to do this.

799
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:41,601
Whilst we were running around the gallery,
she started to translate the code.

800
01:11:41,681 --> 01:11:43,801
It must be on her desk.

801
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:46,921
Taxi!

802
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:51,561
- Entschuldigen Sie, bitte.
- Ja, danke.

803
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:18,041
A book that
everybody would own.

804
01:12:21,881 --> 01:12:22,841
Please, wait!

805
01:12:23,201 --> 01:12:24,481
Bitte!

806
01:12:25,561 --> 01:12:27,441
Was will der?

807
01:12:28,201 --> 01:12:30,201
- Hey, du, was machst du?
- Minute!

808
01:12:30,281 --> 01:12:33,121
Gib mir doch
mein Buch zurück!

809
01:12:35,121 --> 01:12:37,281
Yeah. No, absolutely.
I mean...

810
01:12:37,361 --> 01:12:41,201
...a quiet night in
is just what the doctor ordered.

811
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:46,201
I mean, I love to go out of an evening and
wrestle a few Chinese gangsters generally.

812
01:12:46,281 --> 01:12:49,441
- But a girl can get too much.
- OK.

813
01:12:52,841 --> 01:12:55,961
- Shall we get a takeaway?
- Yeah.

814
01:12:58,121 --> 01:13:01,921
Page 15, entry 1...
Page 15, entry 1.

815
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:06,481
Dead man.

816
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:10,561
You were threatening to kill them.
That's the first cipher.

817
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:17,361
9... 0... 15...

818
01:13:17,681 --> 01:13:21,041
Er, 15 and 36.
36, 39, 39...

819
01:13:22,201 --> 01:13:22,761
39...

820
01:13:24,281 --> 01:13:25,521
9...

821
01:13:30,401 --> 01:13:33,041
"Nine", "mill", "for"...

822
01:13:43,881 --> 01:13:47,201
Blimey, that was quick.
I'll just pop down.

823
01:13:47,281 --> 01:13:50,081
Do you want me
to lay the table?

824
01:13:50,481 --> 01:13:53,001
- Um... eat off trays?
- Yeah.

825
01:13:54,921 --> 01:13:57,041
70... 35...

826
01:14:00,681 --> 01:14:02,041
Jade...

827
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:03,721
Jade.

828
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:09,441
- Sorry to keep you. How much do you want?
- Do you have it?

829
01:14:09,521 --> 01:14:11,761
- What?
- Do you have the treasure?

830
01:14:11,841 --> 01:14:13,801
I don't understand.

831
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:29,041
"Nine mill for...

832
01:14:29,721 --> 01:14:31,121
...jade pin.

833
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:33,481
Dragon den, black...

834
01:14:34,881 --> 01:14:36,321
...tramway."

835
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:48,401
John!
John, I've got it.

836
01:14:48,481 --> 01:14:52,241
The cipher, the book.
It's the London A-Z that they're use...

837
01:15:08,601 --> 01:15:11,961
A book is like
a magic garden...

838
01:15:12,561 --> 01:15:14,921
...carried in your pocket.

839
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:33,161
- Chinese proverb, Mr Holmes.
- I'm...

840
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:35,241
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.

841
01:15:35,721 --> 01:15:38,721
Forgive me if I do not take
your word for it.

842
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:40,521
Ow!

843
01:15:44,761 --> 01:15:47,361
Debit card, name of...
S Holmes.

844
01:15:47,641 --> 01:15:48,681
Take my card.

845
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:51,841
Yes, that's not actually mine.
He lent that to me.

846
01:15:51,921 --> 01:15:57,641
And a cheque for £5,000 made out
in the name of Mr Sherlock Holmes.

847
01:15:57,721 --> 01:16:00,961
Yeah, he gave me that
to look after.

848
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:05,481
Tickets from the theatre collected by you,
name of Holmes.

849
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:06,241
Yes, OK.

850
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:07,801
- What's the name?
- Er, Holmes.

851
01:16:07,881 --> 01:16:11,281
I realise what this looks like.
But I'm not him.

852
01:16:11,361 --> 01:16:15,081
- We heard it from your own mouth.
- What?

853
01:16:15,161 --> 01:16:18,921
"I am Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone."

854
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:22,161
Because no-one else can compete
with my massive intellect.

855
01:16:23,081 --> 01:16:25,241
Did I really say that?

856
01:16:27,601 --> 01:16:32,481
I suppose there's no use me trying
to persuade you I was doing an impression.

857
01:16:34,521 --> 01:16:35,921
I am Shan.

858
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:39,761
You're... You're Shan?

859
01:16:39,841 --> 01:16:44,001
Three times we tried to kill you
and your companion, Mr Holmes.

860
01:16:44,081 --> 01:16:47,721
What does it tell you when an assassin
cannot shoot straight?

861
01:17:02,521 --> 01:17:05,081
It tells you
that they're not really trying.

862
01:17:08,161 --> 01:17:09,521
Tramway.

863
01:17:25,721 --> 01:17:27,041
There.

864
01:17:30,601 --> 01:17:32,801
Not blank bullets now.

865
01:17:34,001 --> 01:17:37,881
If we wanted to kill you, Mr Holmes,
we would have done it by now.

866
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:41,561
We just wanted
to make you inquisitive.

867
01:17:43,561 --> 01:17:45,521
- Do you have it?
- Do I have what?

868
01:17:45,601 --> 01:17:48,681
- The treasure.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

869
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,001
I would prefer
to make certain.

870
01:17:56,921 --> 01:17:59,841
Everything in the West
has its price.

871
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:01,561
And the price for her life:

872
01:18:02,681 --> 01:18:04,681
Information.

873
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:14,041
I'm sorry.

874
01:18:28,521 --> 01:18:31,241
- Where's the hairpin?
- What?

875
01:18:31,321 --> 01:18:35,001
The Empress pin
valued at £9 million sterling?

876
01:18:35,081 --> 01:18:37,081
We already had
a buyer in the West.

877
01:18:37,161 --> 01:18:39,481
And then one of our people
was greedy, he took it...

878
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:42,881
...brought it back to London,
and you, Mr Holmes, have been searching.

879
01:18:42,961 --> 01:18:43,921
Please, please.

880
01:18:44,601 --> 01:18:48,361
Listen to me. I'm not...
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.

881
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:51,321
You have to believe me. I haven't found
whatever it is you're looking for.

882
01:18:51,401 --> 01:18:55,281
- I need a volunteer from the audience.
- No, please, please!

883
01:18:55,361 --> 01:18:58,001
Ah, thank you, lady.

884
01:18:58,081 --> 01:18:59,401
Yes...

885
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:02,921
...you'll do very nicely.

886
01:19:23,321 --> 01:19:30,601
Ladies and gentlemen,
from the distant, moonlit shores of NW1...

887
01:19:30,681 --> 01:19:33,521
...we present
for your pleasure...

888
01:19:33,601 --> 01:19:39,481
...Sherlock Holmes' pretty companion
in a death-defying act.

889
01:19:39,561 --> 01:19:40,521
Please!

890
01:19:43,961 --> 01:19:48,281
You've seen the act before.
How dull for you.

891
01:19:48,361 --> 01:19:49,841
You know how it ends.

892
01:19:49,921 --> 01:19:53,361
- I'm not Sherlock Holmes!
- I don't believe you.

893
01:19:53,441 --> 01:19:55,161
You should, you know.

894
01:19:55,721 --> 01:19:58,161
Sherlock Holmes
is nothing at all like him.

895
01:19:59,041 --> 01:20:03,841
How would you describe me, John?
Resourceful? Dynamic? Enigmatic?

896
01:20:03,921 --> 01:20:06,321
- Late?
- That's a semi-automatic.

897
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:10,801
If you fire it, the bullet will travel
at over 1,000 metres per second.

898
01:20:10,881 --> 01:20:12,961
- Well?
- Well...

899
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:15,161
The radius curvature of these walls
is nearly four metres.

900
01:20:15,241 --> 01:20:18,961
If you miss, the bullet will ricochet.
Could hit anyone.

901
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:22,041
Might even bounce off the tunnel
and hit you.

902
01:21:42,641 --> 01:21:43,641
It's all right.

903
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:48,161
You're going to be all right.
It's over now.

904
01:21:54,521 --> 01:21:56,041
Don't worry.

905
01:21:56,921 --> 01:21:58,801
Next date won't be like this.

906
01:22:12,801 --> 01:22:15,081
We'll just slip off.
No need to mention us in your report.

907
01:22:15,161 --> 01:22:18,281
- Mr Holmes...
- I have high hopes for you, Inspector.

908
01:22:18,361 --> 01:22:20,361
A glittering career.

909
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:23,081
I go where you point me.

910
01:22:24,561 --> 01:22:25,961
Exactly.

911
01:22:32,641 --> 01:22:33,881
Ta.

912
01:22:35,961 --> 01:22:37,121
- So, nine million.
- Million.

913
01:22:37,201 --> 01:22:42,601
Million, yes. Nine million for
jade pin dragon den black tramway.

914
01:22:42,681 --> 01:22:47,281
An instruction to all their London operatives.
A message. What they were trying to reclaim.

915
01:22:47,361 --> 01:22:49,241
- What, a jade pin?
- Worth £9 million.

916
01:22:49,321 --> 01:22:51,201
Bring it to the Tramway,
their London hideout.

917
01:22:51,281 --> 01:22:54,561
Hang on.
A hairpin worth £9 million?

918
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:56,681
- Apparently.
- Why so much?

919
01:22:56,761 --> 01:22:58,881
Depends who owned it.

920
01:23:04,801 --> 01:23:06,881
Two operatives
based in London.

921
01:23:06,961 --> 01:23:09,441
They travel over to Dalian
to smuggle those vases.

922
01:23:09,521 --> 01:23:12,841
One of them helps himself
to something, a little hairpin.

923
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:15,441
- Worth £9 million.
- Eddie Van Coon was the thief.

924
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:17,321
He stole the treasure
when he was in China.

925
01:23:17,401 --> 01:23:19,081
How do you know
it was Van Coon, not Lukis?

926
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:22,441
- Even the killer didn't know that.
- Because of the soap.

927
01:23:34,561 --> 01:23:36,761
- Amanda?
- He brought you a present.

928
01:23:36,841 --> 01:23:38,361
Oh, hello.

929
01:23:38,441 --> 01:23:41,001
A little gift
when he came back from China.

930
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:45,081
- How do you know that?
- You weren't just his PA, were you?

931
01:23:45,601 --> 01:23:47,481
- Someone's been gossiping.
- No.

932
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:50,601
- Then I don't understand why...
- Scented hand soap in his apartment.

933
01:23:50,841 --> 01:23:54,161
300ml of it.
Bottle almost finished.

934
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:55,721
Sorry...?

935
01:23:55,801 --> 01:23:58,361
I don't think Eddie Van Coon was the type
of chap to buy himself hand soap...

936
01:23:58,441 --> 01:24:00,881
...not unless he had
a lady coming over.

937
01:24:00,961 --> 01:24:04,521
And it's the same brand
as that hand cream there on your desk.

938
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:09,681
Look, it wasn't serious
between us.

939
01:24:09,761 --> 01:24:14,041
It was over in a flash, it couldn't last.
He was my boss.

940
01:24:14,121 --> 01:24:16,801
What happened?
Why did you end it?

941
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:21,961
I thought
he didn't appreciate me.

942
01:24:22,041 --> 01:24:23,601
Took me for granted.

943
01:24:25,321 --> 01:24:27,001
Stood me up
once too often.

944
01:24:27,081 --> 01:24:30,881
We'd plan to go away for the weekend
and then he'd just leave.

945
01:24:30,961 --> 01:24:33,281
Fly off to China
at a moment's notice.

946
01:24:33,361 --> 01:24:35,801
And he brought you a present
from abroad to say sorry.

947
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:40,001
Can I just have
a look at it?

948
01:24:46,561 --> 01:24:49,281
He really climbed up
onto the balcony?

949
01:24:49,361 --> 01:24:52,521
Nail a plank across the window
and all your problems are over.

950
01:24:55,081 --> 01:24:56,361
Thanks.

951
01:24:57,321 --> 01:24:59,401
He said he bought it
in a street market.

952
01:24:59,481 --> 01:25:01,601
I don't think that's true.
I think he pinched it.

953
01:25:03,161 --> 01:25:04,161
Yeah, that's Eddie.

954
01:25:04,241 --> 01:25:06,641
Didn't know its value,
just thought it would suit you.

955
01:25:06,721 --> 01:25:08,001
Oh?

956
01:25:08,681 --> 01:25:09,641
What's it worth?

957
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:13,881
£9 million.

958
01:25:17,081 --> 01:25:18,081
Oh, my God.

959
01:25:18,961 --> 01:25:19,681
Oh, my God!

960
01:25:22,041 --> 01:25:23,481
Nine million!

961
01:25:36,721 --> 01:25:40,521
Over 1,000 years old and it's sitting
on her bedside table every night.

962
01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:44,321
He didn't know its value.
Didn't know why they were chasing him.

963
01:25:45,281 --> 01:25:47,841
Should've just got her
a lucky cat.

964
01:25:51,281 --> 01:25:54,241
- You mind, don't you?
- What?

965
01:25:54,681 --> 01:25:57,001
That she escaped.
General Shan.

966
01:25:57,081 --> 01:25:59,121
It's not enough
that we got her two henchmen.

967
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:02,881
Must be a vast network, John.
Thousands of operatives.

968
01:26:02,961 --> 01:26:07,281
- You and I, we barely scratched the surface.
- You cracked the code though, Sherlock.

969
01:26:07,361 --> 01:26:10,121
And maybe Dimmock can track down
all of them, now he knows it.

970
01:26:10,201 --> 01:26:11,441
No.

971
01:26:11,801 --> 01:26:16,921
No, I crack this code, all the smugglers
have to do is pick up another book.

972
01:26:43,961 --> 01:26:45,521
Without you...

973
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:49,601
...without your assistance...

974
01:26:50,081 --> 01:26:53,881
...we would not have found
passage into London.

975
01:26:56,201 --> 01:26:58,121
You have my thanks.

976
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,801
We did not anticipate...

977
01:27:13,401 --> 01:27:16,721
We did not know
this man would come.

978
01:27:18,041 --> 01:27:20,441
This Sherlock Holmes.

979
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:27,441
And now your safety
is compromised.

980
01:27:37,361 --> 01:27:40,321
I will not reveal
your identity.
