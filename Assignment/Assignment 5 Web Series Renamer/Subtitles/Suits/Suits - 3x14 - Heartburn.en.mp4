1
00:00:01,274 --> 00:00:04,075
Why am I being suspended?
I didn't leak any documents.

2
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:06,392
You were unfairly punished,

3
00:00:06,443 --> 00:00:08,778
and I would like
to officially welcome you back.

4
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:10,279
- I want a raise.
- Fine.

5
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:12,499
And Pearson Hardman pays for
law school when I decide to go.

6
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:13,699
Agreed.

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,085
- I fronted your buy-in.
- How could you do that?

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,570
You were about to take
a job somewhere else.

9
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:19,922
We need to start being honest
with each other.

10
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:21,123
You want me off this case,

11
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,925
so I don't get anywhere
near the spotlight.

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,176
In your position,

13
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:26,579
the spotlight can become
an interrogation lamp

14
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:27,963
pretty damn fast.

15
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:30,100
This is always
how it's gonna be, isn't it?

16
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:31,468
I thought you knew that.

17
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:33,469
I guess I did.

18
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:34,674
I need you to use your power

19
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:36,189
to give me this case
over Scottie.

20
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:39,142
Are you asking as a friend,
or are you calling in a chit?

21
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:40,609
Calling in a chit.

22
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:42,695
Does this have something to do
with that favor he did you?

23
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:44,363
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.

24
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,481
I can't.

25
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:46,482
Guess we're not
sharing everything

26
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,368
with each other after all.

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,073
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

28
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:06,135
Time to wake up, sweetie.

29
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:08,954
Oh, five more minutes, mom.

30
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:10,623
Did you just call me mom?

31
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:12,474
What? No.

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,343
Louis,
I've said it before.

33
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:17,847
The bedroom
is a no-mom-talk zone.

34
00:01:17,932 --> 00:01:19,015
Understood.

35
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:21,968
You have to catch your train.

36
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,468
I'll take the later one.

37
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:24,853
Who are you,

38
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:27,073
and what have you done
with my boyfriend, Louis Litt?

39
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,358
Oh, you mean the guy

40
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:30,993
who sweats profusely
before closing arguments?

41
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:32,495
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that guy's gone.

42
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,813
Really?

43
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:37,700
Oh, my God.

44
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:40,152
You're completely dry.

45
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:41,920
Your love has made me dry,
Sheila.

46
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,293
I'm a changed man.

47
00:01:46,343 --> 00:01:49,179
In fact...
I'm gonna rock your world

48
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:51,264
for one more hour, and then I'm
gonna kick some ass in court.

49
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:52,998
'Cause today
nothing can go wrong.

50
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:54,500
Today is my goddamn day.

51
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:57,219
Yeah. It is.

52
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:09,865
Can you pass the sugar?

53
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,451
Yeah, of course.

54
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:16,573
Okay, how 'bout that milk?

55
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:18,024
Sounds great.

56
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:19,241
How would you feel
about me dating other women

57
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:21,860
now that we're
living together and all?

58
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:23,379
Pizza's perfect.

59
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:24,864
Rachel.

60
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,466
What's going on?

61
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:29,385
I got my tuition
payment schedule, and...

62
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,704
Wow.
That is a big bill.

63
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:33,590
Yeah, and that's
not even the problem.

64
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:35,040
Remember when Louis fired me

65
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:36,925
because he thought
that I was leaking information?

66
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,927
I never told you about

67
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:39,929
negotiating the terms
of my return.

68
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:41,313
Yeah, you did.

69
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:43,817
He gave you a 10% raise.
That's not all he gave me.

70
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:45,268
He agreed that the firm
would pay for me

71
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:46,551
to go to law school
when I got in.

72
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:47,603
So what's the problem?

73
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:49,938
It's gonna be
an awkward conversation.

74
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:51,408
Rachel,
you want to be a lawyer,

75
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:53,526
you're gonna have to have
a lot of awkward conversations.

76
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:54,860
Yeah, but not like this.

77
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:56,228
I mean, "Hey, Louis,
do you remember when I demanded

78
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,997
"that you pay for me
to go to law school?

79
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:00,332
"I get that since then you've
now tried to help me get in

80
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,501
"and that we're friends,

81
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:03,703
but I would really
like my money now."

82
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:05,254
Okay.
So don't talk to him.

83
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:08,957
Just get ready to write
a check for $200,000,

84
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:11,927
because that's what it's gonna
cost for the next three years.

85
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:14,597
- Awkward conversation it is.
- Best of luck.

86
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:15,764
Oh.

87
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:17,634
Norma, it's Louis.

88
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:19,936
Louis Litt, your boss.

89
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,221
Don't play your games
with me now, woman.

90
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:23,272
I'm due for closing arguments
30 minutes,

91
00:03:23,356 --> 00:03:24,606
and I need you to stall.

92
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:28,610
No, you do not pull the fire
alarm as a tactic, okay?

93
00:03:28,695 --> 00:03:30,280
I need you to just
buy me ten minutes

94
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:31,647
without committing a crime.

95
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,566
Taxi!

96
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:37,736
There we go.
Come on, baby. My man.

97
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:39,823
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
don't you upstream me.

98
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:41,623
That's my cab.
That's my taxi.

99
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,776
This is my cab.
This is my cab.

100
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:46,663
Hey, I'm gonna sue you.
I'm gonna sue you for sucking.

101
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:48,026
I'm gonna sue you
for not being--

102
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:51,501
okay, I need your name,
date of birth, and I need--

103
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:54,454
all right, let's Litt this up.

104
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,677
Uhoh.
What did you do to Scottie?

105
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:03,430
- Nothing.
- That is not nothing.

106
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,432
That is a soy caramel latte with
a double shot of fear and guilt.

107
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:08,518
That is an apology coffee.

108
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:10,770
Why can't it just be an
"I'm a great boyfriend" coffee?

109
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,138
If you're
such a great boyfriend,

110
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:14,324
why don't you know that
your girlfriend is on her way

111
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:15,525
to Chicago
for the Wexler deposition?

112
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,528
- Oh, shit.
- So I repeat, what did you do?

113
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,814
I overruled her
on Franklin Courier.

114
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:23,500
I made her give the case
back to Louis.

115
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,485
You got in the middle of it?

116
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:26,920
Why would you do that?

117
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:28,004
Look, I don't want to get
into it right now, Donna.

118
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:29,254
Okay.

119
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:32,040
But, Harvey, if you really did
do that to her,

120
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,843
coffee isn't gonna cut it.

121
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:41,468
For the record,
this was not my goal.

122
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:44,836
Mr. Litt.

123
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,055
Sorry, Your Honor.
Sorry I'm late.

124
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:48,673
Are you ready
for closing arguments?

125
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:52,528
Yes, I am.

126
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:55,197
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

127
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:58,367
opposing counsel has accused my
client of a great many things.

128
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:00,353
But you see,
here's the problem.

129
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:05,290
They don't have one single fact
to back up their claim.

130
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:07,043
I mean, not one.

131
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:08,827
So you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna challenge you.

132
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,295
Actually, no, scratch that.

133
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:12,665
I'm gonna dare you
to find dispute

134
00:05:12,716 --> 00:05:15,552
with the facts of this case
as we presented them.

135
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:16,886
'Cause are you a good person?

136
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:18,303
Yes.

137
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:21,139
Are you a good person?
Yes.

138
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:23,675
Are you--actually, you took
notes, so I can see you care.

139
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:27,430
You see, this is the kind
of jury that they teach about.

140
00:05:27,514 --> 00:05:30,567
This is the kind of jury
that's gonna hear me

141
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:32,185
when I say these four words.

142
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:33,718
Do you know
what those four words are?

143
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:36,322
Because I want you
to remember these four words

144
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:37,906
to your dying breath.

145
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:41,411
He didn't do it!

146
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:42,894
He didn't do it.

147
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,540
Mr. Litt, are you okay?

148
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:57,343
I'm all right.
Yeah, I'm fine.

149
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:05,584

00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,271
And?

162
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:47,074
Just go.

163
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,976
Oh, by the way,
how's Mike Ross doing?

164
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:51,196
What are you talking about?

165
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,329
He just came up
with the huge Stemple solution.

166
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,831
He's doing great.

167
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:56,500
So I guess he didn't tell you
about our little conversation?

168
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,485
What conversation?

169
00:06:58,536 --> 00:06:59,487
The one where he ran
into the fact

170
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:01,038
that he has a glass ceiling.

171
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:02,322
Mike knows he has
a glass ceiling.

172
00:07:02,374 --> 00:07:05,677
He knows,
but he didn't <i>know.</i>

173
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:08,713
We have a problem
with William Beck.

174
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:09,963
Who's William Beck?

175
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,500
Division head
of Coastal Radiance Sunscreen.

176
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,351
He's trying to break
his contract.

177
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,353
I assume he has
a non-compete.

178
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,673
No, Harvey, I was dumb enough
to let him do whatever he wants.

179
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:19,673
Why is he trying to leave?

180
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:21,024
He has some ideas

181
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,894
about the product line
that we're not implementing.

182
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,178
Does he have another offer?

183
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,697
- Neutrogena wants him.
- They can't have him.

184
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,262
He can go work at Starbucks, but
he's not touching this market.

185
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:31,702
Excuse me,
but maybe there's a solution.

186
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,906
Coastal Radiance is a division
of Pure Moisture Skincare.

187
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,023
Spin them off.

188
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:38,158
Beck gets to run
his own company,

189
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,377
both stocks go up,
everybody wins.

190
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,495
If I had wanted
the junior associate

191
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:43,067
to come up with an idea,
I'd have asked

192
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:45,917
the junior associate
to come up with an idea.

193
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,918
Tony, he's not wrong.

194
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:50,754
Coastal Radiance is undervalued,
and this fixes that.

195
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,057
Beck has been with us
for ten years.

196
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:55,221
Maybe it's worth running
the numbers on the spin-off.

197
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:56,978
I don't want
to run the numbers.

198
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:58,545
I want him out now.

199
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:00,932
So have your boy work up
the exit paperwork.

200
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:02,382
Jonathan will sign off.

201
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:04,401
Your company, your call.

202
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:10,324
You want to talk about
what just happened in there?

203
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:12,059
Not particularly.

204
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,745
Look, it was a good idea.
He should've listened to it.

205
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,112
I know it was a good idea.

206
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:16,230
What I don't know
is why you didn't push back.

207
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:18,783
Were you in there?
I did push back.

208
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:20,951
When you push back,
you change people's minds,

209
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:22,836
which means either
you didn't agree with me

210
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,572
or you don't care enough
to change his mind.

211
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:26,790
Look, I know when it's time
to change someone's mind

212
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,209
and when it isn't,

213
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,877
and all pushing harder
in that meeting would've done

214
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:31,044
was make him dig in.

215
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:33,096
We had an ally.
Jonathan agreed with me.

216
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:35,048
Yeah, and then he agreed
with his boss,

217
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,551
which is what we're gonna do,

218
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:37,719
because it's the way
the world works.

219
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:39,220
- Come on, Harvey.
- Mike.

220
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,274
This man goes through lawyers
like a hot knife through butter,

221
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,859
and I wasn't
about to get us fired

222
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:46,561
to protect some guy
I don't even give a shit about.

223
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:47,562
Now are you on board
with that?

224
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:49,062
I'm on board.
Can we move on?

225
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:51,065
- I have nothing to move on to.
- I do.

226
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,234
Have you called Scottie
and apologized yet?

227
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:54,284
Apologize for what?

228
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,736
What are you,
the apology police?

229
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:57,038
If you're the one
under investigation,

230
00:08:57,105 --> 00:08:58,322
I'll sign up for that.

231
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:01,241
Jessica, if you need me
to sign any more checks,

232
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:02,442
now would be a great time.
It's Louis.

233
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:03,660
Let me guess.

234
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:05,129
Even though he didn't
show up to the meeting,

235
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:06,913
he's feeling left out
and throwing a hissy fit.

236
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:09,950
He had a heart attack
in court this morning.

237
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:16,341
Oh, my God.

238
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:17,841
He's okay.

239
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,628
I made a call, he's got the best
cardiologists at Mount Sinai,

240
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:22,797
and they say
he's going to be fine.

241
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:25,732
We should go see him.

242
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,402
He told Norma
he didn't want anybody to come.

243
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:30,971
That means he's embarrassed,
but he wants me there.

244
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:35,158
I'll be back
when I'm back.

245
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:39,413
We handle
all his cases personally.

246
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,000
Nothing with Louis' name on it
falls through the cracks.

247
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:44,418
No client finds out
this happened.

248
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:46,336
- Done.
- Done.

249
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:48,873
I'll send him flowers
from all of us.

250
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,424
No.

251
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:52,376
He's allergic.

252
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:54,379
To flowers?

253
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:55,879
All of them?

254
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,798
How do you even know that?

255
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,850
I used to send them
to his desk every day

256
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,335
when we were associates.

257
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:03,187
I know.

258
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:05,472
I'm an asshole.

259
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:08,025
Hey.
He's gonna be okay, right?

260
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:13,697
Oh, my God.

261
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:15,850
This is awful.

262
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,369
Yeah, I know.

263
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:19,854
All morning all I've been
thinking about is how

264
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:21,855
I don't want to talk to him
about the tuition, and now--

265
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:24,625
Hey, Rachel, Rachel.
Hey, come on.

266
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,192
Look at me.

267
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:28,296
He's gonna be okay.

268
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:30,048
He'll be back, and you guys
can have a lifetime

269
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:33,200
of working together,
going to the ballet,

270
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:35,586
having really awkward
conversations.

271
00:10:38,673 --> 00:10:39,874
Rachel,
I'm gonna say the thing

272
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,040
that I know
you don't want to hear.

273
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:42,643
I don't care
about that right now.

274
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:44,595
It doesn't have to be
a big deal.

275
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,397
We've all got Louis' back
right now,

276
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:48,182
and Jessica handles
this stuff anyway.

277
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,485
Just talk to her.

278
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:57,191
You are never allowed
to have a heart attack.

279
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:00,610
Okay?

280
00:11:02,114 --> 00:11:04,030
Understood.

281
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,839
Louis.

282
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:16,427
Is this heaven?

283
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:19,679
I can understand
why you would think that,

284
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:20,764
but no.

285
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:23,049
I don't know
how this can happen.

286
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:27,388
I...Treat my body
like a temple.

287
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:29,690
And you've also been
commuting every weekend,

288
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:31,837
and you let the associates
raise your blood pressure.

289
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,427
- It's because they're stupid.
- Okay, Louis, relax.

290
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,529
The doctors say
you're out of danger,

291
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:36,947
but you shouldn't
get worked up.

292
00:11:37,032 --> 00:11:39,533
- The doctors need to let me go.
- You had a heart attack.

293
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,286
If my blood supply had been
cut off for a half-second less,

294
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,155
it would've been classified
as a minor cardiac event.

295
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,941
And what if it would have
lasted half a second more?

296
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:47,942
It didn't.

297
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:49,710
And I need to get to work.

298
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:52,046
Louis, I'm serious.
You have to cut back.

299
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:53,663
You could have died.

300
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:56,049
And if anything
were to happen to you...

301
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:05,509
Harvey would be a total mess.
Okay?

302
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,798
I'll cut back.

303
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:12,732
Good.

304
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:18,840
Excuse me.
It's Mike, right?

305
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:20,375
Yeah. Did you
still need something?

306
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,259
Because I haven't
finished yet.

307
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,461
I did. I've been
trying to find Louis.

308
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:24,711
He wasn't at the meeting.

309
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:26,847
- Louis isn't here.
- Where is he?

310
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:29,967
What did you need
to see him about?

311
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,936
I want to talk
about what happened.

312
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:35,355
Yeah, um, look,
I know that we both agreed

313
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:37,142
that a spin-off
was the better way to go, but--

314
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:39,360
I don't want
to talk about that.

315
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:40,528
I want to talk about me.

316
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:41,863
I want out.

317
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:43,067
You want to leave
Gianopolous

318
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:44,347
because of what happened
this morning?

319
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,783
What happened this morning
happens every day.

320
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,702
He keeps people down
when they reach a certain point,

321
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:50,654
and I'm pretty sure
I'm at that point.

322
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:52,039
- Yeah, I get it.
- No, you don't.

323
00:12:52,124 --> 00:12:53,524
You don't. No.

324
00:12:53,576 --> 00:12:55,710
In a place like this, your whole
future's laid out for you.

325
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:57,961
You'll be running
the place before 40.

326
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:02,750
Jonathan, we work
for Tony Gianopolous.

327
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:04,034
And I know I don't
have to tell you,

328
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:05,470
but you're working
under the same non-compete

329
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:06,921
that William Beck is.

330
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:09,423
But you work for me too.
Louis is my personal attorney.

331
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:10,557
I know.

332
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:12,259
But if there's
a conflict of interest,

333
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:14,428
we're gonna choose him.

334
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:16,346
I know
that you have a conflict.

335
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:17,380
I'm just asking,
is there any way

336
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:19,216
that you can help me
without...

337
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:21,219
Helping me?

338
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:24,154
I'm sorry.

339
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:26,389
Then where's Louis?

340
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:27,442
Louis is away
on business right now,

341
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:29,559
so he can't help you either.

342
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:31,078
Then I'll find
someone who will.

343
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:34,565
Let this serve as formal notice
I'm letting him go.

344
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:37,585
Michigan Court of Appeals.

345
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:39,953
What?

346
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:41,588
There was a ruling
a few years ago

347
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:45,960
that established a weak link
in the non-compete.

348
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:58,105
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Do you have a minute?

349
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,474
What can I do for you?

350
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:02,693
The timing on this
is terrible,

351
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,312
and I-I apologize for that.

352
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:07,097
What is it?

353
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:09,450
I need the first check
for my law school tuition.

354
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:10,934
Excuse me?

355
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:13,988
Maybe you don't remember, but
when I was wrongfully dismissed,

356
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:15,605
one of the terms
of my rehiring

357
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:17,457
was that the firm
pays for my law school.

358
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:19,293
I remember just fine.

359
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:20,827
And the only term
of your rehiring

360
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:22,797
was a 10% increase
in salary.

361
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,615
What?

362
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:29,169
No, I'm--I'm telling you this
was an agreed-upon term, and--

363
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:31,722
And I'm telling you
I know nothing about that.

364
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,959
And if I had heard about it,
I would have never approved it.

365
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,128
I was scapegoated
by this firm.

366
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:38,895
And when you agreed
to come back,

367
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:40,398
you were given a 10% raise.

368
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:41,566
That's standard.

369
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,234
My situation
was not standard.

370
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:46,403
In what way?

371
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:48,822
Louis accused me
of being disloyal.

372
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:50,741
And?

373
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,659
And he turned out
to be wrong.

374
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:53,995
The problem, Rachel,

375
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,700
is that you have no record
of what you're saying.

376
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:00,418
He agreed to it.

377
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:02,820
He is your agent.

378
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,839
You're bound by this.

379
00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:06,256
I don't know that.

380
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:07,924
And the man just had
a heart attack.

381
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:10,510
And I'm not going
to call him and ask him.

382
00:15:10,596 --> 00:15:12,212
I know that,
and I don't want you to.

383
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:15,048
Then this conversation
is over.

384
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,979
Dr. Iverson
to the cardiac lab.

385
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,864
Dr. Iverson
to the cardiac lab.

386
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:31,615
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sheila.

387
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,350
I'm so sorry.
You should be.

388
00:15:33,402 --> 00:15:34,518
I don't know
why I had a heart attack,

389
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,120
but I promise
it won't happen again.

390
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:40,024
You think I'm mad
because you had a heart attack?

391
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:41,754
It's a sign of weakness.
You hate weakness.

392
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:43,148
No, I hate
that you're doing work.

393
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:44,578
- Sheila--
- No, Louis,

394
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:46,798
do you know what I was thinking
about the whole way down here?

395
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:49,033
I was thinking
that if you died,

396
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,868
I'd want to die too.

397
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,135
So you better start
taking care of yourself,

398
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,303
because I don't want to--

399
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:55,556
- Sheila--
- No. No more work.

400
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,706
Okay, but this isn't
what you think it is.

401
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,091
Don't fight me
on this, please.

402
00:15:58,177 --> 00:15:59,559
- Okay, but I need that--
- Don't fight me on this!

403
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:03,714
"Sheila, as long
as I've known you, I've had a...

404
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:05,716
"I've had a feeling
of completeness.

405
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:10,654
Romeo and Juliet.
Antony and Cleopatra."

406
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,606
You crossed out
Jaime and Cersei Lannister.

407
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:14,532
I thought they were
too controversial a couple.

408
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:16,778
- Too controversial for what?
- A proposal.

409
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:19,496
What?

410
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,081
Sheila, I could've died.

411
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,085
And I don't want my life
to have ended without--

412
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:25,235
Louis, I don't want you to ask
me what you're about to ask me

413
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:26,736
because you're afraid
to die alone.

414
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:28,739
No.

415
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,758
It's not about that.

416
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:38,216
It's not about dying alone.

417
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:41,101
It's about living
without the woman I love.

418
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,192
Sheila Amanda Sazs,

419
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,479
you are the love
of what I hope will be

420
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:55,316
my very, very long life.

421
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,769
And I can't spend one more
second of it without you.

422
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,659
Will you marry me?

423
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:07,278
Yes.

424
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:10,498
Yes, I'll marry you.

425
00:17:20,392 --> 00:17:23,626
Tony,
what can I do for you?

426
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,730
You screwed me over.

427
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:27,464
By figuring out how to fire
the guy you told us to fire?

428
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:30,634
By telling my number two
how to break his non-compete.

429
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:32,806
- I did nothing of the kind.
- Then it was Louis Litt.

430
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:35,690
No way.
That did not happen.

431
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:37,442
That's bullshit, Harvey,
we had a meeting.

432
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:39,309
Jonathan stuck around
for the paperwork.

433
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:41,913
Then suddenly he comes back
with his resignation

434
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,748
and some Michigan
Appeals Court precedent

435
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,148
for breaking our deal.

436
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,334
Well, he couldn't have
met with Louis

437
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:47,667
because Louis wasn't even
in the office.

438
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:49,002
Then it was someone else.

439
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:50,287
Tony, what exactly
do you want?

440
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:51,873
You want me to fire him
like we're firing Beck?

441
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:53,840
I'll tell you
a little secret.

442
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:56,594
I don't give a shit
whether Beck goes or not.

443
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:58,846
But can you understand
why I want him crushed?

444
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:00,714
Because you want
people like Jonathan Sidwell

445
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:02,599
to know what happens
when they try to leave.

446
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,601
Ah.

447
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,669
Finally my lawyer shows up.

448
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:08,855
Oh, I've been here
the whole time.

449
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,857
You see it
how you want to see it.

450
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:13,227
But if you can't figure out
a way to make Jonathan stay,

451
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:16,146
you'll be the one who's gone.

452
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:17,565
Tony.

453
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:21,451
I'm gonna fix this,
but let's get one thing clear.

454
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,320
I'm not like the other lawyers
you've burned through.

455
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:25,323
So the next time
you go stomping around

456
00:18:25,374 --> 00:18:28,209
like a four-year-old
throwing tantrums with me,

457
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:31,496
I'll be the one
getting rid of you.

458
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:36,519
 I guess you were
never really onboard after all.

459
00:18:36,858 --> 00:18:40,045
What?
I did the paperwork for Beck.

460
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:41,210
I'm not talking about Beck.

461
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:42,747
I'm talking
about Jonathan Sidwell.

462
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:44,798
Michigan Court of Appeals
sound familiar?

463
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:48,368
Harvey,
he was gonna fire Louis.

464
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:50,538
If that's the advice
he was looking for from Louis,

465
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:51,873
he'd have fired him anyway.

466
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,224
And Jonathan would've
found that loophole anyway.

467
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:54,675
But instead
he got it from you.

468
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:56,727
What do you want from me?
Louis had a heart attack.

469
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,263
Jessica told us not to--
don't hide behind that shit.

470
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,648
Let's get
into what this is really about.

471
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:02,215
What the hell
are you talking about?

472
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:03,734
I'm talking about
your conversation with Jessica.

473
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:06,386
So that's why you were
telling me my idea was so good

474
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:09,907
after our Gianopolous meeting.

475
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:11,358
Yeah.
We had that conversation.

476
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,826
And yeah, it sucks.

477
00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:14,828
But this has nothing
to do with that.

478
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:16,064
- Then prove it.
- Prove what?

479
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:17,665
He's unhappy
with his situation.

480
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:19,400
When people are unhappy,
they find a way out.

481
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,785
Which brings me
back to my point.

482
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,621
You weren't really on board.

483
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,756
I told you,
I took care of Beck.

484
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,124
Well, now you're gonna
do the same for Jonathan.

485
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,909
The Michigan ruling
clearly states that he has--

486
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,260
Don't quote precedent to me.

487
00:19:29,345 --> 00:19:31,596
You figured out how he could
break the non-compete,

488
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:33,298
now figure out
how to enforce it.

489
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,766
- Harvey--
- Enough.

490
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,017
You're a pretty good lawyer
when you want to be,

491
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:39,136
so maybe try doing it
for our side this time.

492
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:48,980
Bad night?

493
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:51,282
Only if you call
figuring out a way

494
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:53,785
to crush
someone's hopes and dreams bad.

495
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:55,269
What about you?

496
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,707
You, uh, take care
of that awkward conversation?

497
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:03,577
Yeah, it wasn't awkward.
It was...

498
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:06,714
Humiliating.

499
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:08,333
Louis never
actually told Jessica.

500
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,884
What?
That's bullshit.

501
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:13,221
He made a promise to you.
He's an agent of the firm.

502
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:14,588
You know,
I never thought about that.

503
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,141
Maybe I should just
rush to his hospital bed

504
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:18,175
and get him to admit
that he screwed me over.

505
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,347
How could he
lie to me like that?

506
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,232
Rachel, why he lied
to you doesn't matter.

507
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,969
- It matters to me.
- Well, you said it yourself.

508
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,738
Do you really want
to upset him just to find out?

509
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:30,771
Of course not.

510
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:32,240
Then take the emotion
out of it.

511
00:20:32,307 --> 00:20:35,410
- What are you talking about?
- It's a contract problem.

512
00:20:35,477 --> 00:20:38,195
Figure out a way
to enforce the contract.

513
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:46,153
I have someone
here to see you.

514
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:49,374
Donna, I don't have time
to see anyone right--

515
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,377
oh, look who it is.
Where the hell have you been?

516
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:53,595
Harvey, don't be a dick.
He had a heart attack.

517
00:20:53,662 --> 00:20:55,496
And you think
having a heart attack

518
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:58,383
gives you the right
to take the day off?

519
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:04,355
I'm alive.

520
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,357
Help me.

521
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,692
Hug him back.

522
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:14,816
I'm gonna let you two
be alone.

523
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:18,737
Okay, not that I'm not
enjoying this, but...

524
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,020
Shouldn't you be home?

525
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,522
No, the doctor cleared me
to come back.

526
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:23,991
Sheila's allowing me
half days.

527
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,211
The other half of the day...

528
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:27,711
I'm at home
planning my wedding.

529
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:29,197
You're engaged?

530
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,082
It's the happiest moment
of my life.

531
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,201
I'll send my condolences
to the bride-to-be.

532
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,669
That kind of sense of humor

533
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,920
is exactly what I want
of my best man.

534
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:37,644
Louis, are you asking me
to be your best--

535
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:40,208
Harvey, before you answer,

536
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,710
I am sorry my fight with Scottie
put you in a bad situation.

537
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,895
And I know calling in
my chit with you

538
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,300
jeopardized our friendship,
but...

539
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,714
- Louis--
- Let me just finish.

540
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:50,818
You said I can't
have it both ways, but--

541
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:52,987
I'd be honored.

542
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,057
Thank you, Harvey.

543
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,277
You're welcome, Louis.

544
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,422
- Mr. Kovacs.
- Yes?

545
00:22:10,506 --> 00:22:13,007
Mike Ross.
Pearson Specter.

546
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:14,342
Do we have business
together?

547
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:15,926
Jonathan Sidwell.

548
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,332
I understand
you made him an offer

549
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,846
to run
your investment division.

550
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:22,016
Jonathan reached out to me
with a proposal, and I liked it.

551
00:22:22,084 --> 00:22:23,017
Did he happen
to mention the fact

552
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:24,018
that he's under a non-compete?

553
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:25,086
Yes.

554
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,354
He also mentioned that

555
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:27,901
the Michigan Court
of Appeals decision

556
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:29,423
makes his contract breakable.

557
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,608
I had my lawyers look into it.
He's right.

558
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:32,926
Did you also have
your lawyers

559
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:34,929
look into the theft
of intellectual property?

560
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,114
What are you talking about?

561
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:37,597
I'm talking
about the algorithm

562
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,866
that Jonathan developed
to identify

563
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:40,285
companies ripe for takeover.

564
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:42,537
- My employee, my algorithm.
- Wrong.

565
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:44,655
Jonathan developed it
while under contract

566
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,277
with Tony Gianopolous,
which makes it his property.

567
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,996
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

568
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,114
I just came down here

569
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,465
to let you know
you can go ahead

570
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:55,834
and do whatever you care to
with Jonathan Sidwell,

571
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,051
but if you use
his algorithm,

572
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,006
we're gonna sue you for
every penny that comes from it.

573
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:11,482
- Hi.
- Hi.

574
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:12,799
I heard you were back.

575
00:23:12,852 --> 00:23:14,801
Should you be doing that?
Prescribed.

576
00:23:14,854 --> 00:23:17,521
Light walking.
Need to get the blood flowing.

577
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,356
Okay.

578
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:21,241
Good.

579
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:22,911
Look, Louis, I am--

580
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:24,863
I'm sorry about what happened.
I really am.

581
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:27,030
Well, I'm gonna
be fine, Rachel.

582
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,365
Good.

583
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,169
I actually wanted to talk to you
about a contracts issue.

584
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:33,988
- Shoot.
- Okay.

585
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,919
A friend of mine
entered into a verbal agreement

586
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,160
with an agent for a corporation,
and now he's reneging on it.

587
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,545
Wait a second, why verbal?

588
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,880
Why not?

589
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,381
Verbal contracts are binding,
and she knows it.

590
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,432
She have it on tape?
No.

591
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,001
Well, then he can lie about
it, or he can argue the wording.

592
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,721
No, he made a clear promise.

593
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,672
Well, maybe it was
a promise to try,

594
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,858
or maybe it was a suggestion.
No, it wasn't.

595
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:58,278
What's the contract?

596
00:23:58,346 --> 00:24:00,030
Employment bonus.

597
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:01,615
Lump sum
or payable over time?

598
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:03,683
- Three-year term.
- Well, then verbal ain't shit.

599
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:07,204
If it's paid over a year
or more, it has to be written.

600
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:09,039
My friend made life decisions
based on this promise.

601
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:11,192
She could sue
for promissory estoppel.

602
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,192
Well, she could sue
the dick who made the deal,

603
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,577
but she can't sue the company.

604
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:15,747
- She doesn't want to do that.
- Let me ask you this.

605
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,549
Why wouldn't she get it
in writing if it was legit?

606
00:24:18,634 --> 00:24:21,201
Because she trusted him.

607
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,304
She doesn't know
why he would lie to her.

608
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:24,923
He did because he could.

609
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,224
He wanted what he wanted
when he wanted it,

610
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:29,477
and it cost him nothing.

611
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:30,979
You know?
Yeah.

612
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:33,815
Maybe she should go after him.
She could try.

613
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:35,016
But I mean, realistically,
she'll lose, and she should,

614
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,568
because stupidity
shouldn't be rewarded.

615
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:40,721
So glad you came to see me.
You really got my juices going.

616
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:41,739
Make me feel glad to be back.

617
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:51,915
- This is nice, fiance.
- It is nice, betrothed.

618
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,234
So where should we do it?

619
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:57,087
Sheila, are you serious?
I just had a heart attack.

620
00:24:57,172 --> 00:24:59,673
I'm talking
about the wedding.

621
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,509
I say we do it here.

622
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:04,095
Get married in New York?

623
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:06,713
It's where
our relationship began.

624
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:10,018
I think it's only fitting
that we tie the knot here.

625
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:12,470
I love you.

626
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,721
Good, then it's decided.

627
00:25:14,772 --> 00:25:16,089
We'll do it here

628
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,858
and then move
straight to Boston.

629
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:19,309
What do you mean
move to Boston?

630
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,778
I'm not moving to Boston.

631
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:23,698
You have to. You know
what Harvard means to me.

632
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:26,116
You know what
Pearson Specter means to me.

633
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:27,451
Okay, Louis,
there are a dozen firms

634
00:25:27,536 --> 00:25:29,136
that would snap you up
in a second there.

635
00:25:29,203 --> 00:25:30,604
Same goes
for law schools here.

636
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:33,273
Yeah,
but they're not Harvard,

637
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:37,127
which means
they're second tier.

638
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:39,463
You seriously expected me
to drop everything

639
00:25:39,548 --> 00:25:40,714
and move to New York?

640
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:42,549
Yeah, I did.

641
00:25:42,616 --> 00:25:44,635
Okay, well, I think
that's a little presumptuous.

642
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,636
Me?

643
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:47,121
What about you?

644
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,007
You're the one who has us
buying a place on Bacon Hill.

645
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,175
Okay, it's "Beacon Hill,"
and I thought you liked it.

646
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,262
To visit.
I mean, not to live.

647
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:56,931
And what are you talking about,
our law schools are second tier?

648
00:25:56,981 --> 00:25:58,016
Your city is second tier.

649
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:00,468
Well, maybe my city
is second tier.

650
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,988
But it's also the home of
the woman you supposedly love.

651
00:26:04,073 --> 00:26:06,941
Oh, Sheila,
come on, please.

652
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:08,660
I mean, everything I have
is in New York.

653
00:26:08,743 --> 00:26:12,246
Everything except me.

654
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:22,701
It's usually easier
if you look at the screen.

655
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:24,536
With your eyes.

656
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:26,988
I'm...I'm sorry.

657
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:31,041
It's just been
one of those weeks.

658
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:33,211
You know Louis
is gonna be okay, right?

659
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,048
Yeah, I know
he's going to be okay.

660
00:26:37,115 --> 00:26:39,667
But at the moment,
I hate his guts.

661
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:51,296
I hear congratulations
are in order.

662
00:26:51,346 --> 00:26:53,898
Jessica.

663
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:58,103
Another eligible bachelor
bites the dust.

664
00:26:58,153 --> 00:27:00,654
Yeah.
I mean, no, it's--

665
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,906
It's amazing.

666
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:03,357
How are you feeling?

667
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:05,861
Better, thanks.

668
00:27:05,944 --> 00:27:10,315
I wanted to get you
a little welcome-back something.

669
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:12,867
It's not much.

670
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:18,707
You know, you gave me
quite a scare this week.

671
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,508
I love it.

672
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:22,711
The Pearson Hardman retreat
five years ago.

673
00:27:22,795 --> 00:27:26,163
And do you know what I
remember most about that night?

674
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:28,599
What an amazing dancer
you are.

675
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:29,968
Five years,
Long Island School of Ballet.

676
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:32,836
You weren't
dancing ballet that night.

677
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:35,673
Well, they say ballet is
the foundation for everything.

678
00:27:35,724 --> 00:27:39,227
Well, sir, you have
an amazing foundation.

679
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:42,614
I just thought you could
add that to your collection.

680
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:46,451
Somewhere between you and...
Bruno.

681
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:55,710
It means so much to me
that you...

682
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:58,496
Louis.

683
00:27:58,547 --> 00:28:01,365
Come on.

684
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:04,535
After everything
we've been through...

685
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:08,205
You're family.

686
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:16,564
- Holy shit.
- I know.

687
00:28:16,648 --> 00:28:19,317
He betrayed me.
Maybe, but, Rachel,

688
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:21,936
you didn't even give him
a chance to explain himself.

689
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,570
I didn't want to upset him.

690
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:26,240
Even if he was
bullshitting you back then,

691
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:29,160
the Louis I know
is a man of his word.

692
00:28:29,228 --> 00:28:30,945
And if you went to him
honestly--

693
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:32,529
It wouldn't matter.

694
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,730
He would just say
he agreed to it,

695
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:35,165
and Jessica
would still say no.

696
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:36,901
He might offer to pay.

697
00:28:36,952 --> 00:28:39,069
Absolutely not.
I wouldn't let him.

698
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:40,505
And you know what,
that's not the problem.

699
00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:41,789
What is the problem?

700
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:43,194
The problem is
he made me a chump.

701
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:45,175
- Rachel--
- Donna, I went in there

702
00:28:45,243 --> 00:28:48,413
as a paralegal trying
to negotiate with Louis Litt,

703
00:28:48,463 --> 00:28:51,432
and I left with the money
to become a lawyer,

704
00:28:51,517 --> 00:28:52,683
and for the first time
in my life,

705
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,935
I felt like
I could actually be one.

706
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,722
And now I realize that...

707
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:00,474
When I left that room,

708
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,778
he was probably laughing about
how he pulled one over on me.

709
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:05,313
Maybe you're right.

710
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:08,199
But I'm telling you, the Louis
of today would never do that.

711
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:10,567
Well, the Rachel of today
certainly wouldn't

712
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:11,935
let him get away with it.

713
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:14,955
And the Donna of today
is a genius.

714
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,941
Well, the genius of Donna
is every day.

715
00:29:16,992 --> 00:29:19,877
What are you saying?

716
00:29:19,944 --> 00:29:21,628
Just because
you can't go after Louis

717
00:29:21,713 --> 00:29:26,468
doesn't mean you can't
still make your case.

718
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:29,837
What the hell
is wrong with you?

719
00:29:29,922 --> 00:29:31,172
You gave me the map to escape

720
00:29:31,257 --> 00:29:32,423
and told the guards
where I'd be.

721
00:29:32,474 --> 00:29:34,142
- Jonathan--
- Kovacs rescinded his offer.

722
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:35,960
He said I'm not worth it
without that algorithm.

723
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:38,563
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

724
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,647
You gave me that advice
in the first place.

725
00:29:40,732 --> 00:29:42,212
Because you threatened
to leave Louis.

726
00:29:42,268 --> 00:29:43,567
Bullshit.

727
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:45,019
You did it because you knew
what I was up against,

728
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:46,438
and you were
trying to help me.

729
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:47,739
Whether that's true or not,

730
00:29:47,806 --> 00:29:49,240
that advice was
off the record,

731
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:52,359
and it turns out that on the
record it's my job to stop you.

732
00:29:52,444 --> 00:29:54,362
Well, congratulations.

733
00:29:54,446 --> 00:29:56,530
You ripped away
the thing I value the most.

734
00:29:56,615 --> 00:29:58,833
That algorithm--it took me
ten years to develop it.

735
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,535
It's how I look
at valuing companies.

736
00:30:00,618 --> 00:30:01,586
It's how I look at the world.

737
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:04,372
If I can't take it with me,

738
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:05,874
even if someone thinks
I'm worth something, I'm not.

739
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,825
- Jonathan--
- Please.

740
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:09,510
You did your job
on the record.

741
00:30:09,595 --> 00:30:13,515
Now off the record,
what do I do?

742
00:30:13,598 --> 00:30:16,166
It was my job to make sure
there's nothing you could do.

743
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:19,604
Then check in with me
in ten years.

744
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:21,189
'Cause I promise you
I'll be at the same desk

745
00:30:21,272 --> 00:30:23,173
punching the same clock.

746
00:30:23,224 --> 00:30:24,942
Can't move up,
can't move out.

747
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:28,563
It's on you.

748
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:43,193
You were right.

749
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:47,915
This isn't about William Beck
or Jonathan Sidwell.

750
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,416
It's about me.

751
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:51,385
- Mike--
- I want to go legit.

752
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,304
- You can't.
- Harvey, listen--

753
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:54,838
Do I need to state
the obvious?

754
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,208
I can go to law school now,
all right? Get a real degree.

755
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:58,476
Even if it didn't matter

756
00:30:58,544 --> 00:30:59,727
that you've already
presented yourself

757
00:30:59,811 --> 00:31:01,011
as having gone to Harvard law,

758
00:31:01,063 --> 00:31:02,380
you'd have to take
the bar again.

759
00:31:02,431 --> 00:31:03,730
Okay, I passed it once,
I'll pass it again.

760
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:04,982
Not under your own name.

761
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:06,351
And if you take it now,

762
00:31:06,402 --> 00:31:08,385
you'll draw attention
to yourself in a major way.

763
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:10,154
Then I get Lola Jensen
to hack into the bar

764
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:12,272
and just put me in there,
just like she did with Harvard.

765
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:13,441
Are you insane?

766
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:15,192
Hacking into the bar
is twice the crime

767
00:31:15,243 --> 00:31:16,394
you've been committing.

768
00:31:16,444 --> 00:31:17,494
Rule number one
of not getting caught,

769
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:18,913
you don't move
the goddamn body.

770
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:20,397
You do if they're
about to find it.

771
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:21,569
They're not
about to find it.

772
00:31:21,616 --> 00:31:23,617
They're always
about to find it!

773
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:27,288
Mike, committing another fraud
to cover your fraud

774
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:28,739
isn't going legit.

775
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,959
It's just covering your ass,
and it doesn't undo

776
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,742
the fact that you've already
committed the crime.

777
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:36,013
You think I haven't thought
about all of this?

778
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:40,634
Harvey, I'm stuck.

779
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:44,189
There's no way up,
there's no way down.

780
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:50,427
I can't live
my whole life like this.

781
00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:58,603
Okay.

782
00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:01,288
You want to be legit,

783
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:02,789
there's only one way.

784
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:05,410
You go to a small town
in Iowa

785
00:32:05,461 --> 00:32:07,628
where nobody's ever heard
of Harvey Specter,

786
00:32:07,712 --> 00:32:09,463
Jessica Pearson,
or anybody else,

787
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:13,084
you go to law school,
hang out your shingle.

788
00:32:13,134 --> 00:32:15,586
Nobody will ever know.

789
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:17,555
I guarantee you'd be
king of the hill.

790
00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:21,125
But you could never
come back to the mountain.

791
00:32:21,176 --> 00:32:24,761
Not here in New York,
Chicago, or L.A.

792
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:27,481
Someone'll know someone,

793
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:30,518
and it'll all be for nothing.

794
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:34,137
I can't do that,
and you know it.

795
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,823
I do know it.

796
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:39,193
Mike, you're in
the major leagues,

797
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:41,979
and you get to go toe-to-toe
with the best there is.

798
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,833
And I can't tell you
if that's enough for a lifetime,

799
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:49,253
but if you want to stay,
there's nothing more you can do.

800
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,923
My advice is hold on tight
and enjoy the ride.

801
00:33:02,554 --> 00:33:04,605
What are you doing here?

802
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:05,972
I'm here to help you.

803
00:33:06,023 --> 00:33:07,891
You said there was no way
to stop what you did.

804
00:33:07,976 --> 00:33:11,144
This isn't a legal solution.
It's a business solution.

805
00:33:11,195 --> 00:33:14,030
One where everybody wins.
Everybody wins?

806
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:15,281
That's what you said
about Beck.

807
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:16,700
So you want me
to spin off my own company,

808
00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:17,701
I run it, he owns it?

809
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:20,353
I never said that.

810
00:33:20,404 --> 00:33:21,904
Well, he didn't
go for it with Beck.

811
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,790
Why would he go for it
with me?

812
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:27,911
Because he doesn't give
a shit about William Beck.

813
00:33:27,996 --> 00:33:30,998
What are you saying?

814
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:32,883
You develop your algorithm
every day.

815
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:33,884
Of course.

816
00:33:33,968 --> 00:33:35,035
It's useless if I don't.

817
00:33:35,086 --> 00:33:36,220
Right, but that's not
why you do it.

818
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:37,304
You do it because you love it.

819
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:38,888
Well, he can
force me to stay,

820
00:33:38,972 --> 00:33:40,641
but he can't force me
to love it.

821
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,041
And that's exactly
where your leverage is.

822
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:45,813
If you don't love what you do,
it costs him a fortune.

823
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,763
And he knows it.

824
00:33:47,848 --> 00:33:49,732
This isn't a sure thing.

825
00:33:49,817 --> 00:33:50,817
Which is why
I'm trusting he won't know

826
00:33:50,884 --> 00:33:52,603
it came from me
if it doesn't work.

827
00:33:52,686 --> 00:33:55,939
Why are you doing this?

828
00:33:56,023 --> 00:34:00,360
Let's just say
I love my job...

829
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:03,396
but I know what it feels like
to be trapped.

830
00:34:09,871 --> 00:34:11,538
Donna said
you wanted to see me

831
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:13,840
about some more
managerial bullshit.

832
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:15,242
What?

833
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:17,126
Don't you think I learned
my lesson with the checks?

834
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:20,746
- Then why am I here?
- You're here to listen to me.

835
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:23,349
Do you know
what this is about?

836
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,585
Yes.
And I already told you--

837
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:28,387
I am not here to ask you
to honor Louis' contract.

838
00:34:28,438 --> 00:34:31,807
I am here to ask you
to make a new one with me.

839
00:34:31,893 --> 00:34:33,025
Our contract with you

840
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:34,360
is a promise of a job
when you get out,

841
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:36,563
not paying for you
on your way in.

842
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:38,447
I have a list here
of the signing bonuses

843
00:34:38,532 --> 00:34:41,985
of the top three associates
who have come into this firm.

844
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,436
Give me an advance on mine.

845
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,456
The last time we negotiated,
you said,

846
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:49,126
"never sign something without
getting something in return."

847
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,077
What you're getting
in return

848
00:34:51,128 --> 00:34:53,664
is that I keep working here
part-time.

849
00:34:53,748 --> 00:34:57,117
The advance, plus my salary,
will cover my tuition.

850
00:34:57,168 --> 00:34:59,585
Paralegals
don't make that much.

851
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:00,971
Those numbers don't add up.

852
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:02,838
I'm not proposing
being a paralegal.

853
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:05,259
Summer associates
work as lawyers,

854
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,626
and I can do the same.

855
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:09,628
You came up with that
pretty fast.

856
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:11,231
It's almost
as if you wanted me

857
00:35:11,298 --> 00:35:12,983
to ask you
what I get in return.

858
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,518
- Do we have a deal?
- One problem.

859
00:35:15,603 --> 00:35:18,605
You already asked me
to break precedent once

860
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:21,240
when I waived
the Harvard rule.

861
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:23,643
I'm not breaking it again
to pay for law school.

862
00:35:23,695 --> 00:35:26,163
I'm not asking you
to break anything.

863
00:35:26,246 --> 00:35:30,867
You already established
precedence, with him.

864
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:33,954
When you paid
for his law school.

865
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:35,655
That is not
common knowledge.

866
00:35:35,706 --> 00:35:38,175
No, it's not.

867
00:35:38,259 --> 00:35:40,043
That's why
she wanted me here.

868
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:41,929
I'm exhibit A.

869
00:35:41,996 --> 00:35:43,130
You made an investment
in Harvey,

870
00:35:43,181 --> 00:35:45,681
and I think
that turned out pretty well.

871
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:48,101
I could argue that point.

872
00:35:48,168 --> 00:35:51,688
No, Rachel's right.
I'm pretty awesome.

873
00:35:51,773 --> 00:35:53,505
I assume you have this
in writing.

874
00:35:53,557 --> 00:35:55,442
I wouldn't be worth it
if I didn't.

875
00:35:55,509 --> 00:35:58,695
Let me guess.
He went for it.

876
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,347
He did.

877
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,153
You want me to set up
your new corporation?

878
00:36:07,204 --> 00:36:10,023
I want you to join
my new corporation.

879
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:13,210
It's an offer letter.

880
00:36:13,293 --> 00:36:14,661
I don't understand.

881
00:36:14,711 --> 00:36:16,329
You said you know
what it's like to feel trapped.

882
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,998
Thought maybe
you'd like a way out.

883
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,367
- I also said I love what I do.
- Maybe.

884
00:36:20,418 --> 00:36:23,536
But let me tell you
what I once told Louis Litt.

885
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:26,922
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.

886
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:28,925
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

887
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,762
Wait a second.

888
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:35,148
You're not asking me to be
your in-house counsel.

889
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:36,900
You kidding me?

890
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:39,318
Most people don't even know
what an algorithm is.

891
00:36:39,387 --> 00:36:43,273
You used it to strong-arm me
and Tony Gianopolous.

892
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:45,108
You have a mind for this.

893
00:36:45,193 --> 00:36:46,860
Jonathan...

894
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:50,246
You don't have
to answer right now.

895
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:51,998
Just think about this.

896
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:56,202
You're in
the minor leagues here.

897
00:36:56,253 --> 00:37:00,423
I'm giving you a chance
to play in the majors.

898
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,811
I'm glad you came.

899
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:24,931
I hope you don't mind.

900
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:27,701
I thought you might like it.

901
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:33,106
- Sheila...
- It's just a gesture.

902
00:37:33,157 --> 00:37:35,108
It's a beautiful gesture.

903
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,376
You're so...

904
00:37:37,445 --> 00:37:39,612
You're everything.

905
00:37:39,664 --> 00:37:41,797
Oh, no,
is this where you tell me

906
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:46,420
that you're not gonna
move to Boston?

907
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:49,005
Not everybody sees me
the way you do.

908
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:53,460
Most people take a very,
very long time to figure me out.

909
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,396
It's taken me years and years
to get the people here to see

910
00:37:57,465 --> 00:38:01,233
past my short temper
and my...

911
00:38:01,302 --> 00:38:03,070
Weird obsessions.

912
00:38:03,137 --> 00:38:04,737
Your love of mudding
is not weird.

913
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:08,157
Well, you see, I know that.

914
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:11,193
You know who else knows that?

915
00:38:11,278 --> 00:38:12,311
Donna,

916
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:15,699
Jessica, Mike, Rachel,
and Harvey.

917
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:19,652
They appreciate me.

918
00:38:19,704 --> 00:38:20,836
They're my family.

919
00:38:20,922 --> 00:38:22,672
I'm asking you...

920
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:25,342
Please don't make me
leave my family.

921
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:30,663
I'll move to New York.

922
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:36,769
Yeah.

923
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:39,773
- You won't regret this.
- I know I won't.

924
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,175
I promise I'm gonna
give you the best life.

925
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:44,143
We're gonna be
a New York power couple.

926
00:38:44,195 --> 00:38:45,677
Law by day,
love by night.

927
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,780
And when we have kids,
world, watch out.

928
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:51,067
Sazs-Litts,
they're gonna be ridiculous.

929
00:38:51,152 --> 00:38:52,369
Wait, what?

930
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:54,454
I mean, let's face it.
Our kids?

931
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:57,023
They hit the genetic lottery.

932
00:38:57,074 --> 00:38:59,326
Louis, I don't want kids.

933
00:38:59,376 --> 00:39:01,378
What?

934
00:39:01,461 --> 00:39:03,295
They don't get me.

935
00:39:03,364 --> 00:39:06,532
What? I mean, what--
what are you talking about?

936
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,217
I don't like kids.

937
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:11,670
I like when they're 22
and going to law school,

938
00:39:11,722 --> 00:39:12,755
but I just...

939
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Those would be adults.

940
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:18,144
Exactly.

941
00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:20,931
No, no, no.

942
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:25,985
You may think that now,
but when it actually happens,

943
00:39:26,052 --> 00:39:29,322
when--when they're yours,
it's so--

944
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:32,891
Louis, I'm never
gonna think that, ever.

945
00:39:34,394 --> 00:39:37,896
