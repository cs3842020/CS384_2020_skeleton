1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:01,732
Previously on Suits...

2
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:03,033
What do you mean
you can't take the case?

3
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:04,535
Jessica won't lay out the
money for the man-hours.

4
00:00:04,897 --> 00:00:06,629
One of the victims was my uncle Keith.

5
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:08,902
Please. These people need your help.

6
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,843
I didn't come forward. They found me.

7
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,378
And I'm not pulling any associate shit.

8
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:13,446
Then what do you call

9
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:14,913
this pathetic excuse
of a candidates list?

10
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:17,216
I call it inevitable, because
our students can read.

11
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:19,576
Our future is slipping
away, and offering Jack

12
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:22,178
name partner or praying
to God that Harvey

13
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:23,914
just gets Mike off the hook

14
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,782
isn't gonna stop it from happening.

15
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:28,051
Then you get your ass
back up to Harvard,

16
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:31,354
and you make sure Sheila
doesn't show up to that trial.

17
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:32,689
It's a ticket to Argentina.

18
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:34,190
I need you to go there
until the trial's over.

19
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:36,637
Court's not about bullshit
like this; it's about facts.

20
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:38,572
And the fact is, you're
not a goddamn lawyer.

21
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:40,274
Are you saying what I
think you're saying?

22
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:41,641
Because if you're thinking
it, you're a fool.

23
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:43,077
You heard her.

24
00:00:43,112 --> 00:00:44,711
She said the fact is, is that
I'm not a goddamn lawyer.

25
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:46,012
Well, the only way to change that fact

26
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:47,781
is for a jury to see me
be a goddamn lawyer.

27
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:49,249
You try that, all they're gonna see

28
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:50,484
is someone going to prison.

29
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:51,952
It's my call, and I'm making it.

30
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:54,088
We have a problem. They found Trevor.

31
00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:09,813
Please raise your right hand.

32
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:11,915
Do you swear to tell the truth,

33
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,616
the whole truth,

34
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:15,585
and nothing but the truth,

35
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,221
so help you God?

36
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:19,389
I do.

37
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:20,556
You may be seated.

38
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:26,103
Mr. Evans, how long
have you known Mr. Ross?

39
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:27,871
Since we were kids. Almost 20 years.

40
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:29,240
So you were close to him?

41
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:31,008
Yeah, he was my best friend.

42
00:01:31,043 --> 00:01:32,309
Are you still close to him?

43
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:33,877
Well, I doubt we will be after this.

44
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:35,513
After what?

45
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:37,148
After you ask me about
the series of events

46
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:39,082
that have led us all to be here today.

47
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:40,817
Well, we'll get to your
history in a minute,

48
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:43,420
but first, I want to ask you a
question about current events.

49
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,605
Did Mike Ross approach
you three days ago

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,341
in an attempt to get you not
to testify against him?

51
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,680
Yes, he did.

52
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,117
How exactly did that conversation go?

53
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,253
What are you doing here?

54
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,788
You know exactly what I'm doing here.

55
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,256
You said you would not testify.

56
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,690
Yeah, well, that was before
Anita Gibbs dragged me in

57
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,159
and told me she was gonna
put me away for ten years.

58
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,593
I don't give a shit what she told you.

59
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,828
You said you were gonna call a lawyer.

60
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,329
Yeah, well, before I
had a chance to do that,

61
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:12,831
they showed me what they had,

62
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,826
which is names, dates,
witnesses, and everything else

63
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:17,462
they need to put me away
for as long as they want.

64
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:18,663
Wait, wait, how would they have...

65
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:20,198
You think I want to do this?

66
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,667
I don't.

67
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:24,135
But I cannot risk prison for you.

68
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:26,003
And I am telling you
that whatever they have,

69
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,338
Harvey can get you out of this.

70
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:28,506
And from what she told me,

71
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,074
Gibbs can get you out of this.

72
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,677
She offered you a deal that can
make this whole thing stop.

73
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:34,779
Now, instead of telling me
not to testify against you,

74
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:36,881
why don't you think about
testifying against Harvey?

75
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,983
Because unlike you, I would
never do that to a friend!

76
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:40,785
Yeah, well, unlike you,
when they put me away,

77
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,888
I'm not going to a white-collar prison.

78
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:46,897
So if I don't rip you to
shreds up there on the stand,

79
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,700
they're gonna rip me
to shreds behind bars.

80
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,401
Harvey, it's late.
I've had a long day.

81
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:01,502
So if you don't mind...

82
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:03,137
We have a problem.

83
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:04,639
What now? My condo's on fire?

84
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:07,275
Mike wants to represent himself.

85
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,544
Is he crazy? He can't do that.

86
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:10,878
That's what I tried to tell him.

87
00:03:10,913 --> 00:03:12,380
You don't try; you just tell him.

88
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:13,847
Yeah, the only problem with that is,

89
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:15,383
he knows it's his decision.

90
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,318
Not to mention, the only
thing that's stopping him

91
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:19,019
from going to Gibbs and
pointing his finger

92
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:21,289
at you or me is his loyalty to us.

93
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:22,523
So that's it?

94
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:24,257
He's representing himself?

95
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:25,224
I'm not saying that.

96
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,593
Then what exactly are you saying?

97
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:28,394
I'm saying I have a plan,

98
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,863
but I need you to sign off on it.

99
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:32,231
Oh, whatever it is, I'm in.

100
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:34,033
Because if that kid
handles his own defense,

101
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:36,302
you and I are going to be
the next ones on trial.

102
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:44,963
If you're here to find out
if Trevor's testifying, he is.

103
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:46,464
I can handle Trevor.

104
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:47,899
Harvey, we've been over this.

105
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,700
And I said we're not
done being over it.

106
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:52,203
Listen to me, I know that
fool-for-a-client bullshit.

107
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,539
But the thing I'm being accused
of is not being a lawyer.

108
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:57,008
So if I represent myself,
every second I'm up there,

109
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:58,376
they're gonna see me as a lawyer.

110
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,878
And if she rattles you for
one of those goddamn seconds,

111
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:02,880
they're gonna see you as a
fraud, and they're never

112
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,115
gonna see you as anything else.

113
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:05,317
Okay.

114
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:06,584
I got it. You said your piece.

115
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:09,187
It's my call. I'm done talking about it.

116
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,881
Then we'll do a trial
run to get you ready.

117
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,285
Are you crazy?

118
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:18,187
You want to waste my
time, not to mention

119
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:20,122
air our dirty laundry, in
front of the whole firm?

120
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:23,259
Mike, in a week and a half,
our dirty laundry is gonna be

121
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:24,861
aired in front of the whole world.

122
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:26,463
And Gibbs is gonna come at you in ways

123
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:28,064
you've never even thought about.

124
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,165
Oh, so I get it.

125
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,500
You don't want a trial
run to get me ready;

126
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:32,535
you want a trial run to show
me that I'm outmatched.

127
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:34,371
You are outmatched by me and Gibbs,

128
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:35,839
and you're afraid to find out.

129
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:38,074
I'm not afraid of Gibbs,
and I am not afraid of you.

130
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:40,243
Then you won't mind
agreeing, if I beat you,

131
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:42,011
you let me represent you in court.

132
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:48,551
Okay, Harvey, you want to go?

133
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:50,754
Let's go.

134
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:52,389
But you better bring your A game.

135
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:55,157
Because you might be the
best closer in the city,

136
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:57,226
but I'm the one fighting for my life.

137

-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

138
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,824
Thank you.

139
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,326
There he is.

140
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:34,594
Harold.

141
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:35,906
What are you doing here?

142
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:37,574
I know what's going on, okay?

143
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,842
I know about the trial coming up.

144
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:40,411
Then you know I'm
pretty busy right now.

145
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:42,813
Right, which is why I
wanted to talk to you.

146
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:44,581
Listen, you're gonna
need someone to testify

147
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:46,116
that you went to Harvard.

148
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:47,217
I want to be that guy.

149
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:48,952
Harold, that's an
amazing offer, but...

150
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:51,588
Mike, come on, man.

151
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:54,205
We both know that you
didn't go to Harvard.

152
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:55,472
But honestly, if anyone

153
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:56,774
would have asked me up until this point,

154
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,609
I would have sworn that you did.

155
00:05:58,644 --> 00:05:59,910
I would have sworn that I saw you

156
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:01,578
at that... that party with Gilcrest

157
00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:03,213
or those pizza nights at Pinocchio's

158
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:05,982
or pretty much any other
memory I have of that time,

159
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:08,151
which means, if they put
me up there on that stand,

160
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:11,388
I'd basically be telling the truth.

161
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:13,857
I can't tell you how much that
means to me, Harold, but...

162
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:15,893
Mike, I want to do
this for you, please.

163
00:06:15,928 --> 00:06:17,327
I know you do.

164
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:18,629
But I got myself into this mess,

165
00:06:18,664 --> 00:06:21,598
and I got to get myself out of it.

166
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:22,566
Okay.

167
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:24,868
But listen, if you change your mind,

168
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:27,170
you know where to find me.

169
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:30,909
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

170
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:32,411
you're gonna be hearing a lot of things

171
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:33,879
over the next several days,

172
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:35,680
but the truth is, this case is about

173
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:37,282
nothing more than cold, hard...

174
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:39,251
Innuendo.

175
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:41,487
And the fact is, I'm capable
of reciting every element

176
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:43,422
of jurisprudence in the
state of New York.

177
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:45,690
And yet despite that, the
prosecution is gonna

178
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:47,493
try to convince you that I am a...

179
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:50,095
Fraud, who not only
didn't pass the bar or go

180
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:52,915
to law school, he didn't
even graduate college.

181
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,282
There isn't one piece of hard evidence

182
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:57,985
proving that I didn't go to Harvard Law.

183
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,054
There's no record of
tuition being paid.

184
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,756
No record of a Boston address.

185
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,724
There isn't even a simple
picture in the yearbook.

186
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,992
Let's talk about the yearbook.

187
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:06,928
As he told you, I'm not in the yearbook.

188
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:08,062
Where is Mike Ross?

189
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:09,564
Though what he didn't tell you is that

190
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,766
25 other students are also
not in this yearbook.

191
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:13,912
Are those other students
being charged with fraud?

192
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:16,647
Of course not, because we
don't put people on trial

193
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:19,483
for being sick on picture
day, and no matter...

194
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:23,720
What he says, the fact is,
Mike Ross is not a lawyer.

195
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:25,122
He's a fraud.

196
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:28,392
And we will prove that
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

197
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:30,328
The defense would like
to call its first witness.

198
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:32,396
Right there... he's such a non-lawyer,

199
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:34,298
he doesn't even know the
prosecution goes first.

200
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:35,466
And you obviously don't know

201
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:38,169
Jarvis v. the State of New York, 1937,

202
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:39,503
when calling of the first witness

203
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:41,305
is of such special nature as to disrupt

204
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:44,075
the flow of the trial once it's started.

205
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:46,551
What the hell special
nature are you talking about?

206
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:48,018
When the defense wants
to call the prosecutor

207
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:49,867
as its first witness.

208
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:51,934
Harvey, unless you have
something to overturn this,

209
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,469
I'm gonna need you to have a seat.

210
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:58,407
Mr. Specter, you said
there's no record of me

211
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:00,409
ever having an apartment in Boston.

212
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:02,245
Can you explain to the
jury why there's no record

213
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,445
of you ever having lived there?

214
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:05,047
I'm not the one on trial here.

215
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,115
No, you're not.

216
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,216
You're the one in that chair,

217
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:08,384
so why don't you answer the question,

218
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:09,952
or we can stop this
whole thing right now.

219
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:11,620
There's no record of me living there

220
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:14,556
because I sublet up there when
I had my place down here.

221
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:15,624
So it is possible

222
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,426
that a person not have a Boston address

223
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:20,129
without it meaning that
they didn't attend Harvard.

224
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:23,388
Great. Thank you so much.

225
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:25,157
This witness is excused.

226
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:26,625
And what, exactly, is your reason

227
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,260
for not having an address up there?

228
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:31,030
Unless you're too afraid
to answer my questions.

229
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,832
No, I'm not afraid of you at all.

230
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,633
My reason is that I chose
to live with my friend

231
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:36,235
Trevor during that time.

232
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,737
The only problem with that is,

233
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:40,372
your friend Trevor has lived
in Brooklyn his entire life.

234
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:42,608
Exactly a 3 hour and 20
minute drive from Harvard.

235
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:44,643
So you're saying you
made that drive every day?

236
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:45,945
No, I only went up for tests

237
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,195
because that's all I had to do.

238
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:50,764
I guess you needed some
extra tutoring?

239
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,133
You expect these people to
believe that you graduated

240
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:55,002
from the most competitive
law school in the world

241
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:56,436
without ever going to class?

242
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:58,071
See, that's funny,
because you actually

243
00:08:58,106 --> 00:08:59,305
expect these people to believe

244
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:00,707
that I never went to law school at all

245
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:02,342
and yet still somehow
managed to convince

246
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:04,144
the smartest lawyers in the world

247
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,647
to make me their youngest partner ever.

248
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:10,684
Whose story is looking
more far-fetched now?

249
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:14,203
Oh, no answer? Great.

250
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:15,436
No more questions, Your Honor.

251
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,174
I don't know if you've
noticed this or not,

252
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,142
but he's kicking your ass.

253
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:22,911
And I'm about to kick back.

254
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:24,078
Are you two discussing something

255
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:25,346
that defense should be made aware of?

256
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,749
Just talking about the Knicks.

257
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,920
Now is the prosecution ready
to call their first witness?

258
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:34,555
The prosecution's first
witness is this affidavit

259
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,657
from every single member
of the defendant's

260
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:38,226
supposed graduating class.

261
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:39,994
Objection, Your Honor.
I haven't seen that.

262
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,595
Well, then let me read it to you.

263
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:44,379
"We collectively come forward to swear

264
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:47,316
"the following regarding
Michael James Ross:

265
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:49,818
"We never saw him. We never knew him.

266
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:52,220
"We never heard of him.

267
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:55,390
"And it makes us sick that
he's taking the good name

268
00:09:55,426 --> 00:09:58,527
"of Harvard Law School and
throwing it down the toilet.

269
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:00,562
Please find him guilty on all counts."

270
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:02,844
Your Honor, I move to strike
that document right now.

271
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:03,576
On what grounds?

272
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:04,899
On the grounds that it's
completely fabricated.

273
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:06,201
Where's your proof?

274
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:07,669
Besides the fact that I
actually went to Harvard,

275
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:08,970
there's no way you could have contacted

276
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,753
all of those people since last night.

277
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:12,687
Then I suggest you call
every one of these people

278
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:13,922
and put them on the stand.

279
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:15,890
But when you do, every
single one of them is gonna

280
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:18,626
look you in the eye and say,
"Who the hell are you?"

281
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:26,501
What? No snappy comeback?

282
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:29,295
You can try to trick these
people all you want.

283
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,829
But the fact is, you
didn't go to Harvard,

284
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,798
and this proves it.

285
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,567
Objection. He's testifying.

286
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,968
What I'm doing is winning.

287
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,803
All right, that's enough.

288
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,206
I think this is a good
time to take a break.

289
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:55,274
Louis Litt.

290
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,575
I'm Anita Gibbs.

291
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:57,876
Yeah, I know who you are.

292
00:10:57,912 --> 00:10:59,345
Question is, what are you doing here?

293
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,713
And the answer is, I don't give a shit.

294
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:01,880
I came here to compliment you

295
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,516
on getting rid of Sheila's ass.

296
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,299
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

297
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,039
Really? You think I don't know
what's going on here?

298
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:09,475
You two were in a relationship,
and when you found out

299
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:10,909
that it was her that wrote that email,

300
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:13,078
you went up to Cambridge
and convinced her to go to

301
00:11:13,113 --> 00:11:14,880
Argentina for the duration of the trial.

302
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:16,381
You're out of your mind.

303
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,716
Am I?

304
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:19,785
You flew to Boston three
times in the last two weeks.

305
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,219
You took two cabs to her house

306
00:11:21,254 --> 00:11:24,522
and another to within 100 feet
of the admissions office.

307
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,458
You have no proof of anything.

308
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:28,060
I don't need proof.

309
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:30,495
Because while she may
be in Argentina now,

310
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,064
she's not gonna stay there forever,

311
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,099
which means when she gets back,

312
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:36,367
I get you for witness tampering.

313
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:38,737
Do me a favor and leave
me the hell alone.

314
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:39,871
I will.

315
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,306
For now.

316
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,610
But if she's not back
by the start of trial,

317
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:47,679
I'm gonna assume that you want
to be brought up on charges.

318
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:55,885
You son of a bitch. This isn't real.

319
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,287
I don't give a shit
whether it's real or not.

320
00:11:57,322 --> 00:11:59,289
You think Gibbs isn't gonna
do things like that?

321
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:01,391
She is not gonna enter false
evidence, and you know it.

322
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:02,859
But she is gonna set up traps for you

323
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:04,060
to bungle into like I just did.

324
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:05,195
This is such bullshit.

325
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,097
You are just pissed because
I was kicking your ass

326
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:08,331
so now you're cheating.

327
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:09,399
Me?

328
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:10,633
You're the one who testified in your

329
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:12,168
opening statement and
every chance you get.

330
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:15,732
Because that's exactly what me
being my own lawyer gives us.

331
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:16,832
I don't care.

332
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,934
If I represent you and
it turns out that you

333
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:21,036
need to testify, we can
call you up to the stand.

334
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:23,939
And if we do that, then Gibbs
gets to cross-examine me

335
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:25,273
and make me look like a liar.

336
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:26,474
Well, I don't know if you've noticed,

337
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,010
but you're looking
like a liar right now.

338
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,079
And I'm trying to keep you
from looking like a fool.

339
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:31,718
You know what? I'm
getting pretty tired

340
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:32,919
of you using that word with me.

341
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:34,187
Too bad, because for all your

342
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:36,356
bullshit up there, you still
can't produce one person

343
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:37,690
who remembers you from Harvard.

344
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:40,394
So if you want to have a chance
at representing yourself,

345
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,729
get out of my face and
go work on your defense

346
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:44,898
'cause I got a lot more
where that came from.

347
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:55,562
EXCLUSIVE FROM TUSUBTITULO

348
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,000
What can I do for you, Louis?

349
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:00,770
- Gibbs knows what I did.
- What?

350
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:02,237
She knows I got Sheila
out of the country.

351
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:03,472
She was waiting for me this morning,

352
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:04,973
and she threatened to
bring charges against me.

353
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:07,009
- Did you admit that to her?
- No.

354
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:08,844
Then she's not gonna
charge you with anything.

355
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,452
Did you hear what I just said?

356
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:11,719
She knows I went to Sheila's place

357
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,154
the same night she went to Argentina.

358
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:14,421
And what does that prove?

359
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:15,489
It proves that I knowingly

360
00:13:15,524 --> 00:13:16,758
bought a witness a ticket
out of the country

361
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:18,583
in the middle of an
ongoing investigation.

362
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:20,817
All it proves is, you
rewarded a Harvard employee

363
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:22,586
who's been steering
lawyers towards this firm

364
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:23,820
for the last ten years.

365
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:26,156
Okay, Jessica, Gibbs can
easily go down to Argentina

366
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,123
and ask Sheila...

367
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,059
Louis, listen to yourself.

368
00:13:29,094 --> 00:13:30,594
She's not going to do that.

369
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:32,962
And even if she did, it's
not witness tampering

370
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:34,665
if a subpoena was never issued.

371
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,366
Then Gibbs is gonna say
that I had knowledge

372
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:39,103
of an impending subpoena;
therefore it is tampering.

373
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:41,038
You know what, Louis?

374
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:42,806
I don't give a shit what Gibbs says.

375
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:46,609
Where are you going?

376
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:48,778
Give that woman a taste of
her own goddamn medicine.

377
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:51,915
Where the hell are you going?

378
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:53,583
We've got Mike on the ropes;
we have to put him away.

379
00:13:53,618 --> 00:13:54,751
Sorry, Harvey.

380
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:55,886
Something more pressing just came up.

381
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:57,420
What the hell could be
more pressing than this?

382
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:59,756
You worry about your shit,
and I'll worry about mine.

383
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,491
Oh, I've got my shit taken care of.

384
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:03,227
Well, maybe you do,
and maybe you don't.

385
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:05,162
But what I've learned
from recent history is,

386
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:08,065
if you really were Anita Gibbs,
no matter what you had planned,

387
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,433
you'd be planning something else.

388
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:19,864
Donna, please, not right now.

389
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:20,832
I'm so busy.

390
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:21,833
That's fine.

391
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:22,967
I just came by to let you know that

392
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:24,268
Jessica had to go out,
so the trial is done

393
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:25,369
for the rest of the day.

394
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:26,403
And Harvey wasn't gonna tell me

395
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:27,538
because he's playing dirty.

396
00:14:27,574 --> 00:14:29,073
He's not your enemy, Mike.

397
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:30,908
He's just doing what he thinks is best.

398
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:33,010
Then I'm gonna do
what I think is best.

399
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:34,479
And what exactly is that?

400
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,158
Donna, he may not be my enemy,

401
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:39,494
and you may not be my enemy,

402
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:42,630
but as long as we're in this trial run,

403
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,532
I'm not trusting you with anything.

404
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:49,471
That's my boy.

405
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,176
Jessica Pearson,

406
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:56,877
I wasn't aware we had
an appointment today.

407
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:58,213
We don't.

408
00:14:58,248 --> 00:14:59,947
I just stopped by to give
you this restraining order,

409
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,382
preventing you from
contacting Louis Litt

410
00:15:01,418 --> 00:15:02,850
without his attorney present.

411
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:05,120
And let me guess...
his attorney is you.

412
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,554
Bingo.

413
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:09,022
So unless you're going to arrest him,

414
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:11,625
you so much as text him
without me present,

415
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,695
and you're in violation
of a court order.

416
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,514
You're done driving a wedge
between me and my people.

417
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:20,717
We'll see how strong your
bond is with your people

418
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,685
when I parade every one
of them on the stand

419
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,020
and ask them point-blank,

420
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,289
"Did you know Mike Ross was a fraud?"

421
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,391
You think we're gonna have
different answers to that?

422
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:31,296
No, I think you're all
gonna take the Fifth.

423
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,364
And you're gonna tell
yourselves it implies no guilt,

424
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,098
but in the eyes of the
jury, you might as well

425
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,833
all just stand up there
and say he did it.

426
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:41,038
So you tell your client
he's off the hook for now.

427
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,940
But the next time I talk to
him, it will be on the stand.

428
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:54,161
Hey, I got your message.

429
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:55,162
So here I am.

430
00:15:55,197 --> 00:15:56,664
But let me tell you something, Mike,

431
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,432
if you're here to ask what
I think you're gonna ask,

432
00:15:58,467 --> 00:15:59,734
gonna be a short conversation.

433
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:01,568
I need you to say you
remember me from Harvard.

434
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:03,537
There's just one small problem, Mike.

435
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:05,139
I don't remember you.

436
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,042
'Cause you didn't go there, did you?

437
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:10,077
Look me in the eye and
tell me that I'm wrong.

438
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,407
God damn you, Mike. I... I knew it.

439
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:14,407
Jimmy... Jimmy!

440
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:15,841
When we first started, you begged me

441
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:17,177
to help you save your career.

442
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:18,645
No, no, no, no, Mike.
This is not the same thing.

443
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,146
I-I could have gotten you disbarred.

444
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:21,781
But it couldn't have got me
sent to jail, and you know it.

445
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:23,249
I don't care!

446
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:24,617
All right? I need your help.

447
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:26,752
Mike, you are asking
me to perjure myself,

448
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:28,054
and I don't even know who you are.

449
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:29,389
Yes, you do.

450
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:32,158
I am the same guy you came to
when your aunt needed help.

451
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:34,360
What? So I owe you for that too?

452
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:35,895
Yeah, you do.

453
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,363
You and I both know if I get convicted,

454
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,764
that settlement's gonna get reopened.

455
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,567
Then why the hell did
you take it, Mike?

456
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:41,880
Why?

457
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,349
Jimmy, I took a shortcut, man.

458
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:50,686
Just like you took a shortcut once.

459
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:53,555
Now, if I could take it all
back, I would, but I can't.

460
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:55,191
And just like you begged me once,

461
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:57,193
I am coming to you and
begging you right now.

462
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:59,328
Please.

463
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:00,797
Please help me.

464
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:05,618
No one in their right mind

465
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:08,121
would do what you're asking me to.

466
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,889
That's not true.

467
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:12,092
Harold come to you?

468
00:17:12,127 --> 00:17:13,260
But you know Harold

469
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:15,762
won't hold up on the stand and I would.

470
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:17,030
Right?

471
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:18,365
- Jimmy, I need you...
- Michael.

472
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:21,901
Look, brother, I'm sorry.

473
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:23,236
I really wish I could help,

474
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:25,638
but I cannot risk going
to prison for you.

475
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:26,964
I can't.

476
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:44,732

477
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:45,833
Hello?

478
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,802
Louis, it's me.

479
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:49,571
Sheila, I explicitly told you,

480
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:51,506
"Do not call me until
after the trial is over."

481
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:52,574
We can't take any chances...

482
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,242
Someone approached me, Louis.

483
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:55,743
What do you mean
someone approached you?

484
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:56,944
At my hotel.

485
00:17:57,253 --> 00:17:58,953
I was in the lobby.

486
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:01,088
A man came up to me and started talking.

487
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,289
He said he was from New York.

488
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:03,624
He wanted to know how long I'd been

489
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,959
planning a trip to Argentina.

490
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:08,033
Then he asked how long I
was planning on staying

491
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:09,835
and, finally, did anyone pay

492
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,804
for my ticket to come down here?

493
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,106
W-what did you tell him?

494
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:14,474
That it was none of his business.

495
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:15,708
Good. That was smart.

496
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:17,276
You didn't show them
that they got to you.

497
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:18,811
Louis, they did get to me!

498
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:20,379
Listen to me.

499
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:22,815
They did not subpoena you,
so you did nothing wrong.

500
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,617
You just took a trip.

501
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:28,521
Now, if Gibbs can prove anyone
did anything, it is me.

502
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:32,225
And I will do anything
to protect you, okay?

503
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,160
I'm sorry, Louis. I have to go.

504
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:41,776
I don't believe you.

505
00:18:41,811 --> 00:18:43,343
You're calling Rachel
as your first witness?

506
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:44,645
I sure as hell am.

507
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:47,048
Gibbs can't call Rachel.
We took care of that.

508
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,016
We took care of her
going out of bounds

509
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:50,250
to get Rachel to turn on you.

510
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:51,886
We didn't do anything to
stop her calling Rachel

511
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:53,187
to the stand, and you know it.

512
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:54,455
Fine, then I'm stipulating right now

513
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,957
Rachel's taking the
Fifth to any questions.

514
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:56,924
Oh, bullshit.

515
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,092
You know as well as I do,

516
00:18:58,127 --> 00:19:00,493
she can't take the Fifth
to personal questions.

517
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:01,859
So you're just gonna humiliate her

518
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:02,994
so you can rattle me?

519
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:04,195
You're damn right I am.

520
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:05,696
Gibbs is gonna do the exact same thing.

521
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:07,132
She is not gonna do that to Rachel

522
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,367
in front of a jury, because it
will make her look like shit.

523
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:10,868
She doesn't care about that.

524
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:12,570
No, you're the one that
doesn't care about that.

525
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,672
'Cause this is no longer about
what's best for my case;

526
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:16,783
it's because you don't
want to lose to me.

527
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:18,216
I'm not going to lose to you.

528
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:19,451
You know what, Harvey? I am...

529
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:20,752
That's enough.

530
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:22,353
While you two have been
having your pissing contest,

531
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:24,289
I've been poring over
discovery, and I came across

532
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:26,157
the class rankings from
Mike's first year.

533
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:27,559
Don't tell me... he's not on it.

534
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:29,360
- No, he's not.
- Doesn't make any sense.

535
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:30,395
Yes, it does.

536
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,497
Lola must not have
covered all the bases.

537
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:34,629
Then we need to get her
to cover all the bases.

538
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:35,931
Are you out of your mind?

539
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,566
You go to Lola, you lead
Gibbs right to her,

540
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:40,501
and this thing is over
before it even gets started.

541
00:19:40,537 --> 00:19:41,903
Okay, then we get Benjamin to do it.

542
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,605
We are not letting another
person in on your secret.

543
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,873
Well, then what do you suggest we do?

544
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:47,242
What we were gonna do
with every other piece

545
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:49,465
of evidence that makes
us look like shit.

546
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:51,567
We find a way to make it look like shit.

547
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:54,003
There is no way that
Harvard accidentally forgets

548
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:55,504
to put a student on this list.

549
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,805
I say we go to Benjamin.

550
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:58,273
And I say I'll lock you in a room

551
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:00,576
until this trial starts
if you say that again.

552
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:06,481
Then I guess whoever
wins makes the call.

553
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:10,085
You go to Benjamin behind
my back before we're done,

554
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,486
and you going to prison is gonna be

555
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:12,955
the least of your problems.

556
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:25,802
Mike, you like you've
been through the wringer.

557
00:20:25,837 --> 00:20:29,139
I have to ask you a question, and...

558
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:31,074
I want you to tell me the truth.

559
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:33,088
Well, of course.

560
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:34,923
Do you really think I
should be the one up there

561
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,991
fighting for my life, or do
you think Harvey should be?

562
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,829
I think that...

563
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,232
you're the best person
to make that call,

564
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:48,335
and that whatever you
decide, I'm with you 100%.

565
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:50,672
Well, then I need to ask
Benjamin to do something for us,

566
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:54,241
and Harvey is really not gonna like it.

567
00:20:57,238 --> 00:21:00,806
Whatever it is, if you
think we need to do it,

568
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,575
I'm with you.

569
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:07,773
UNIVERSITAS HONORIUS
MICHAEL JAMES BOSS - JURIS DOCTOR

570
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:13,882
It's done?

571
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:15,618
Yes.

572
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:18,887
It won't hold up forever, but
it will hold up for now.

573
00:21:18,922 --> 00:21:21,590
Thank you, Benjamin. I...

574
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:23,259
I didn't expect it for
a couple of hours.

575
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:25,193
I-I haven't had a chance
to get you any bacon.

576
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:27,296
That's quite all right, Michael.

577
00:21:27,331 --> 00:21:29,064
This one is on the house.

578
00:21:32,513 --> 00:21:33,880
You know, you never asked if what

579
00:21:33,915 --> 00:21:36,983
they're saying about me is true.

580
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:39,218
I didn't need to.

581
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:41,120
I knew it was true the
second I heard it.

582
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:42,554
I don't understand.

583
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,990
All these kids who went to Harvard,

584
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:45,324
they never gave me the time of day.

585
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,126
All they cared about was letting me know

586
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:50,062
where they went to school and I didn't.

587
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:52,064
You've never done that to me.

588
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,166
Not one time.

589
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:56,158
I... I don't know what to say.

590
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,228
Say that when you're done
and you've beaten this thing,

591
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:03,898
you won't start acting like some
asshole who went to Harvard.

592
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:07,601
Well, I mean, can't really
promise you that, Benjamin.

593
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:09,737
I'll have gone to Harvard.

594
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:11,605
That's not funny, Michael.

595
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,477
Is the prosecution ready
to call its next witness?

596
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:28,813
Prosecution calls Rachel Zane.

597
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,147
Objection.

598
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,683
Your Honor, the witness
cannot object to testifying

599
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,318
simply because she intends
to take the Fifth.

600
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,358
The witness doesn't have to
testify because she's my wife.

601
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,291
What?

602
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:39,459
I have a marriage certificate here

603
00:22:39,494 --> 00:22:40,894
from the state of Nevada showing that

604
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:42,495
the witness and I were
married in Las Vegas

605
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,564
six weeks after we started dating.

606
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:47,033
Both of you up here, now.

607
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,809
Where the hell did you get that?

608
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:49,910
What do you mean?

609
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:51,444
You didn't marry her, and you know it.

610
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,913
Then why do I have everything
I need proving I did?

611
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:54,548
Because you did some
bullshit to get out of this.

612
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,349
Oh, look who's crying about it now.

613
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:57,484
Keep your voices down.

614
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,952
You think this is a joke?

615
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:00,153
You try this in court,

616
00:23:00,188 --> 00:23:01,955
Gibbs is gonna prove you're not married,

617
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:03,690
and Rachel's gonna go
to jail for perjury.

618
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:05,258
He's right; you better know
what the hell you're doing.

619
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:07,060
Who said that I was gonna
use this in the real trial?

620
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,362
I get it. This is a
fake, just like you.

621
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:10,497
I said keep your goddamn voice down.

622
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:12,298
This is as real as that
affidavit was, okay?

623
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:15,769
Now, you wanted to rattle
me; I've rattled you.

624
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:17,103
What are you gonna do about it?

625
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:20,073
Prosecution calls
Rachel Zane to the stand.

626
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,708
Objection. We just went over this.

627
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:24,611
When spousal privilege
is invoked in the moment,

628
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:26,413
prosecution has the right to challenge

629
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,015
the validity of the marriage.

630
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,183
- This is ridiculous.
- Objection overruled.

631
00:23:30,218 --> 00:23:32,532
Ms. Zane, take the stand.

632
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:33,732
We can skip swearing her in

633
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:35,468
since she's just gonna
lie about it, anyway.

634
00:23:35,503 --> 00:23:36,669
Objection!

635
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,939
Ms. Zane, if you got married
six weeks after dating

636
00:23:39,975 --> 00:23:42,375
the defendant, why are you
engaged to him right now?

637
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,477
Because we did it on a whim.

638
00:23:44,512 --> 00:23:46,079
And we had planned to have an annulment,

639
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:49,648
but once we fell more in
love, we thought that it

640
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:51,517
might be wonderful to
reveal it to our families

641
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,885
after we were married again.

642
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,953
And how, exactly, did it go

643
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:55,388
when you got married the first time?

644
00:23:55,423 --> 00:23:56,622
We were in Las Vegas...

645
00:23:56,657 --> 00:23:58,091
Yeah, yeah, I don't give
a shit where you were.

646
00:23:58,126 --> 00:24:00,059
What color was your dress?
What color was the cake?

647
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:01,527
- Objection.
- Who was there?

648
00:24:01,562 --> 00:24:03,162
- Were there any witnesses?
- Your Honor, he's badgering...

649
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:04,930
Who were the witnesses? And
what goddamn time was it?

650
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:06,299
Your Honor, get him off of her!

651
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:07,333
- Harvey...
- Tell me right now.

652
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:10,103
Let the witness answer.

653
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:12,856
The dress was white.

654
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:15,792
And the cake was vanilla
with a buttercream frosting.

655
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:19,596
It was a small ceremony
at around 10:00 p.m.

656
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:21,397
And I remember the man who married us

657
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:23,066
like it was yesterday

658
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:26,870
because it was the most
special day of my life.

659
00:24:27,277 --> 00:24:28,543
And when you came up with this story,

660
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:30,212
did Mr. Ross at least
give you the courtesy of

661
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:31,679
letting you make up your own memories

662
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:32,914
of your supposedly sacred day?

663
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:33,982
Objection.

664
00:24:34,018 --> 00:24:35,817
Since, if he represents
himself at trial,

665
00:24:35,852 --> 00:24:38,720
you won't have a real wedding
for at least two to five years.

666
00:24:38,755 --> 00:24:39,754
Harvey.

667
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:41,223
And I've got one more question:

668
00:24:41,258 --> 00:24:44,792
did you vow to remain
faithful to Mr. Ross

669
00:24:44,828 --> 00:24:46,094
throughout your marriage?

670
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,162
Yes, I did.

671
00:24:47,197 --> 00:24:49,364
Yeah, then I guess
when you cheated on him

672
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,034
with Logan Sanders, it
means you lied to him

673
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:53,701
at that non-existent ceremony,

674
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:55,970
just like you're lying
to all of us right now.

675
00:24:56,006 --> 00:24:58,440
That's enough.

676
00:24:58,475 --> 00:25:00,509
If you want to bring
more outside information

677
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:05,247
to dispute this marriage, feel
free, but for right now...

678
00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:06,748
this witness is excused.

679
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:18,771
Louis, whatever it is,
it's going to have to wait.

680
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:20,406
No, it's not gonna
wait, because you said

681
00:25:20,441 --> 00:25:21,507
you'd take care of Gibbs.

682
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:22,741
I did take care of Gibbs.

683
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:24,743
Well, then why the hell
did someone from her office

684
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,645
contact Sheila in Argentina?

685
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:28,614
Louis, they're just
trying to scare you.

686
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:30,349
And even if she tells them everything,

687
00:25:30,384 --> 00:25:32,351
you did nothing wrong with Sheila.

688
00:25:32,386 --> 00:25:34,420
What about what we did with Mike?

689
00:25:34,455 --> 00:25:36,956
The only proof they'll ever
have that we knew about Mike

690
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:38,825
is if we tell them.

691
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,393
And when they ask me, I'm
going to take the Fifth,

692
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:43,635
and you are going to do the same thing.

693
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:44,701
That is not good enough.

694
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:45,869
I don't want to take the Fifth.

695
00:25:45,904 --> 00:25:47,036
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

696
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:49,038
You get called first, you get up there,

697
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:50,574
and you look them straight in the eye,

698
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:52,142
and you tell them Mike went to Harvard.

699
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,910
It was your decision to hire him,

700
00:25:53,945 --> 00:25:56,036
and you stand by it 100%.

701
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:57,503
What's going on?

702
00:25:57,538 --> 00:25:59,638
What's going on is that
Jessica's happy asking me

703
00:25:59,673 --> 00:26:01,273
to witness tamper, but
when it comes to her

704
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,574
getting on the stand, she won't...

705
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,310
Witness tamper? What
did you have him do?

706
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:05,944
She had me move Sheila
out of the country.

707
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,912
Are you crazy?

708
00:26:06,947 --> 00:26:08,147
Look, I did what I had to do.

709
00:26:08,182 --> 00:26:09,915
Then why won't you do
what you have to do for me?

710
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,318
Because if I did that, it
would open me up to perjury.

711
00:26:12,353 --> 00:26:14,260
If Mike gets convicted, what does it
matter if you perjure yourself?

712
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:16,444
Both of you be quiet.
Look who's coming.

713
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:20,192
Look who it is. The Three Musketeers.

714
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:21,727
And we happen to be in
the middle of a meeting.

715
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:23,496
That's okay; I just
dropped by to let you know

716
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:25,597
it looks like the trial's
been moved up till tomorrow.

717
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:26,832
What the hell did you do?

718
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:28,934
I went to the judge,
and I said, "Your Honor,

719
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:30,569
"I'd like to start this thing before

720
00:26:30,604 --> 00:26:32,371
every single witness I have disappears."

721
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:34,406
No way she granted
this without us present.

722
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:36,241
Oh, you can fight it, if you want.

723
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:40,246
We'll wait for Ms. Sazs
to finish her trip.

724
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:43,949
Oh, Mr. Litt seems upset about that.

725
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:45,751
Looks like the wedge I'm
driving between you

726
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:47,386
is starting to work.

727
00:26:49,622 --> 00:26:51,188
Your wedge hasn't done shit.

728
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,426
And I'm gonna tell you something else.

729
00:26:56,462 --> 00:26:58,395
You put me on that stand,

730
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,830
and I will look the jury
straight in the eye

731
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:03,400
and tell them that Mike Ross is the best

732
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:06,872
goddamn Harvard-educated
attorney I have ever met.

733
00:27:06,873 --> 00:27:08,238
I hired him.

734
00:27:08,274 --> 00:27:11,809
It was my decision, and
I stand by it 100%.

735
00:27:11,844 --> 00:27:13,811
And everyone that comes after me

736
00:27:13,846 --> 00:27:15,345
will say the same thing.

737
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,920
You think she bought that?

738
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:24,421
I don't care if she bought it or not.

739
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:25,489
I wasn't bluffing.

740
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:26,790
And you and Mike better figure out

741
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,025
what the hell you're going to do

742
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,027
because the trial starts tomorrow.

743
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:41,628
What a coincidence running into
you here twice in one week.

744
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:43,228
You can skip trying to cheer me up,

745
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:45,330
because it's not gonna work.

746
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:48,033
- Rachel...
- I don't want to hear it.

747
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:51,236
He humiliated me in front
of the entire firm.

748
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:52,638
Yeah, he did.

749
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:54,973
But you weren't sure if Mike
could handle this or not.

750
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:58,243
And at least now, if he can't,

751
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:00,012
you won't have to be
the one to tell him.

752
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:01,847
That is so easy for you to
say, because you have no idea

753
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:03,248
what it felt like to go through that.

754
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:04,249
You're wrong.

755
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:05,951
I know exactly what it feels like.

756
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:08,905
What are you talking about?

757
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,309
Try to imagine how he treated
me when I left him for Louis.

758
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:14,444
Maybe you do know.

759
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,112
Yeah. I do.

760
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,059
And...

761
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,008
I also know that, like nobody else,

762
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:26,309
Harvey has this ability

763
00:28:26,344 --> 00:28:31,848
to just shut off and not see
you as a person anymore.

764
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:34,918
Well, that ability makes me sick.

765
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,939
It's also probably one of the things

766
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:38,340
that makes him such a great lawyer.

767
00:28:46,217 --> 00:28:48,184
- What are you doing here?
- We got a problem.

768
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:53,222
You mean besides what you did today?

769
00:28:53,257 --> 00:28:55,023
- Mike, listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

770
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:57,593
- That was over the line...
- The trial starts tomorrow.

771
00:28:57,628 --> 00:28:59,462
What?

772
00:28:59,497 --> 00:29:01,163
No. Gibbs can't do that.

773
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,465
Technically she can't,

774
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,800
but trust me, we don't
have a leg to stand on.

775
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,546
Fine.

776
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:08,281
Then I'm filing the motion
to be my own attorney.

777
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:09,549
- Mike...
- No, I don't want to hear it.

778
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:10,884
You didn't beat me, all right?

779
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,813
So you can be second chair or
no chair, but I am first chair.

780
00:29:13,814 --> 00:29:14,355
God damn it, Mike.

781
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:15,455
You don't know what you're doing.

782
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,690
Do you really think I'm gonna let you

783
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:18,191
protect me after what you
did to Rachel today?

784
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:19,660
I did that to Rachel for you,

785
00:29:19,695 --> 00:29:21,628
and if you can't see that,
you can't win this trial.

786
00:29:21,664 --> 00:29:22,963
I can, and I will!

787
00:29:22,998 --> 00:29:26,266
That's enough!

788
00:29:26,553 --> 00:29:28,086
Rachel, it's fine. I can handle this.

789
00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:29,955
I don't care. I don't
want you to handle this.

790
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:37,743
What?

791
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:38,944
You said you were with me 100%.

792
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:40,346
Was that a lie?

793
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,948
No, but what Harvey had to
do to me today was brutal,

794
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:44,750
and whoever ends up
representing you has to do

795
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:46,985
the same thing to Trevor.

796
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,086
But you don't think I can do
the same thing to Trevor?

797
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,689
I know you can.

798
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:54,759
But I hated Harvey while
he was doing it to me,

799
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,727
and they're going to hate you

800
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:58,395
while you're doing it to Trevor.

801
00:29:58,431 --> 00:30:02,470
And, Mike, we can't have
the jury hating you,

802
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:03,834
but we can let them hate Harvey.

803
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,210
Mr. Evans, is it true that
you were living with Mr. Ross

804
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,146
in and around the time he claims
to have attended Harvard?

805
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:18,447
Yes, we shared an apartment

806
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,849
at 5307 Huntington
Boulevard in Brooklyn.

807
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,052
And how exactly did he pay his rent?

808
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,187
He worked as a bike messenger
and made money on the side

809
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,922
taking the LSATs for people.

810
00:30:27,317 --> 00:30:29,117
Oh, wait, I'm confused.

811
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:30,952
Why would he have to resort to that

812
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:32,554
if he were a college graduate?

813
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,322
Because he wasn't a college graduate.

814
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:35,957
What?

815
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:38,260
You mean he never
graduated from college?

816
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:42,798
No, he was kicked out of
college for cheating on a test.

817
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,567
Well, isn't it possible

818
00:30:45,603 --> 00:30:48,537
that while he was living with you,

819
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:52,612
he went back to school and
completed his degree?

820
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:54,546
Well, I don't see how,
since most of his spare time

821
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:56,648
was spent sitting around
smoking weed with me.

822
00:30:56,684 --> 00:30:58,717
Well, let me get this straight.

823
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:01,453
Before he was employed
at Pearson Specter,

824
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:03,856
to the best of your
knowledge, he worked as

825
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:07,893
a bike messenger and a
part-time LSAT imposter?

826
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:10,361
Yes.

827
00:31:10,396 --> 00:31:12,230
One last question, Mr. Evans.

828
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:14,665
Is it at all possible that Mike Ross

829
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:20,138
ever attended Harvard Law School?

830
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:21,772
Not unless they had
a satellite campus at

831
00:31:21,807 --> 00:31:24,542
5307 Huntington Boulevard in Brooklyn.

832
00:31:28,108 --> 00:31:29,975
No more questions, Your Honor.

833
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,044
Given that you smoked
all this pot, Mr. Evans,

834
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,846
isn't it possible that if
Mike Ross commuted one day

835
00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:37,248
a week to Harvard Law that
you might not remember that?

836
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:38,316
I'd remember.

837
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:39,751
Yeah, maybe you would, but you'd lie

838
00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:41,553
through your teeth about
it anyway, wouldn't you?

839
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,021
Objection.

840
00:31:43,057 --> 00:31:44,489
Mr. Evans, isn't it true
that you're a long-time

841
00:31:44,524 --> 00:31:47,425
drug dealer and your testimony
today is only happening

842
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:51,290
because you signed a deal with Ms.
Gibbs giving you immunity?

843
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:52,223
Doesn't mean I'm lying.

844
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:53,291
Because you wouldn't lie

845
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:54,525
just to get out of going to prison?

846
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,826
No, I would not.

847
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:57,795
Well, how about if the
other reason was to get back

848
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,763
at someone you've been
jealous of your entire life?

849
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:02,320
I've never been jealous of
Mike Ross in my entire life.

850
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:03,788
And I just caught you in a lie.

851
00:32:03,823 --> 00:32:05,122
Objection, Your Honor.

852
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:07,258
Mr. Evans, my next
move is gonna be to call

853
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:08,859
Jenny Griffith to the stand,

854
00:32:08,895 --> 00:32:12,330
and she's gonna testify that
you lied to her for years

855
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:14,732
about dealing, and when
she found out about it,

856
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,434
she left you for Mike Ross.

857
00:32:16,469 --> 00:32:18,117
Objection. Badgering.

858
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:20,051
She's also gonna say that
you were jealous of his mind

859
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:23,121
your entire life, and when you found out

860
00:32:23,156 --> 00:32:25,791
that she left you for
him, you were as jealous

861
00:32:25,826 --> 00:32:27,125
as a human being can be.

862
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,994
- Now, is that true or not?
- Your Honor.

863
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:30,428
Let me rephrase.

864
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,365
Is Ms. Griffith going to be
perjuring herself or are you?

865
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:36,602
Yeah, I was jealous of him.

866
00:32:38,712 --> 00:32:41,346
And if he lied about all of
that, what's to make us believe

867
00:32:41,381 --> 00:32:43,481
that he wasn't lying
about everything else?

868
00:32:47,654 --> 00:32:49,822
No further questions, Your Honor.

869
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:59,965
Your Honor, prosecution calls
Donna Paulsen to the stand.

870
00:33:03,337 --> 00:33:05,170
Don't worry, Donna.

871
00:33:05,206 --> 00:33:09,674
She won't ask you point-blank
if you knew Mike was a fraud.

872
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,144
What if she does?

873
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:13,979
If you lie,

874
00:33:14,014 --> 00:33:15,247
they'll never know.

875
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:26,995
Ms. Paulsen, it's my
understanding that you arranged

876
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,430
Mr. Specter's interviews for
the position currently filled

877
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,398
by Michael Ross.

878
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:31,399
Is that correct?

879
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:32,767
I assisted in the process, yes.

880
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,869
Did you find it
suspicious that Mr. Ross

881
00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:36,971
wasn't listed on the
Harvard class ranking

882
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:38,039
from his first year?

883
00:33:38,074 --> 00:33:39,908
- No, I didn't.
- And why is that?

884
00:33:39,943 --> 00:33:41,709
Because I've never been
on any class ranking,

885
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:43,811
and I'm the best legal
secretary in the city.

886
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,813
That's a quippy response, Ms. Paulsen.

887
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:47,916
But if you were so good at
your job, how would you

888
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:50,585
allow someone who wasn't
even on the interview list

889
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,386
to get in a room alone
with Harvey Specter?

890
00:33:52,422 --> 00:33:54,355
I'm sure you'll recognize this list.

891
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,891
After all, you typed it up.

892
00:33:56,927 --> 00:34:00,127
And it looks like his name
isn't on this one either.

893
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,996
No, he wasn't on the list,
but he was smart enough

894
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:03,230
to talk to his way in,

895
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:05,332
which is what a good
lawyer does and exactly

896
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:06,434
what I was looking for.

897
00:34:06,469 --> 00:34:08,235
How exactly did he talk his way in?

898
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,207
Answer the question, Ms. Paulsen.

899
00:34:13,242 --> 00:34:15,577
He took someone else's spot.

900
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:18,312
You mean he said he was someone else.

901
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,881
You're under oath, Ms. Paulsen.

902
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:23,518
May I remind you that perjury carries
a sentence of up to five years?

903
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:26,688
Did he say he was someone else?

904
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,558
He said he was Rick Sorkin.

905
00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:33,595
So your first introduction to Mr.
Ross was as an imposter?

906
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,662
I didn't say that.

907
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,564
You said he lied about
what his name was.

908
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,634
That makes him an imposter.

909
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:42,369
Are you going to recant your testimony?

910
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:44,405
Don't look at him.

911
00:34:47,343 --> 00:34:48,743
No, I'm not recanting.

912
00:34:48,778 --> 00:34:50,044
All right.

913
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,715
So now we've established that Mr.
Ross is a liar.

914
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,551
And now we're gonna find
out if you're a liar.

915
00:34:57,587 --> 00:35:00,154
So, Ms. Paulsen,

916
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:02,490
to the best of your knowledge,

917
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:06,160
did Mike Ross go to Harvard
Law School or not?

918
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:17,171
I'd like to assert my
Fifth Amendment right.

919
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,912
Don't feel bad, Ms. Paulsen.

920
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:28,783
I'm sure others will do
the same thing too...

921
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:30,685
because...

922
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,756
the defense cannot produce one person

923
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:38,026
who can place Mike Ross at Harvard Law.

924
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,431
The witness could be
excused, Your Honor.

925
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,167
I think we've heard all we need to hear.

926
00:35:59,649 --> 00:36:02,083
Defense would like to call
Jimmy Kirkwood to the stand.

927
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,051
Objection.

928
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:04,385
His name was not on the witness list.

929
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,687
Rebuttal witness.

930
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:07,655
She just said we can't
produce someone who places

931
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:08,990
Mike at Harvard, and I say we can.

932
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:10,058
Your Honor...

933
00:36:10,093 --> 00:36:11,659
Mr. Specter is within his rights.

934
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:14,261
Mr. Kirkwood can take the stand.

935
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,297
How did you know he'd testify?

936
00:36:16,332 --> 00:36:18,632
I didn't until just now.

937
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,407
Well, when I first
met Mike, I thought,

938
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:28,375
"Who is this asshole

939
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,678
who only ever shows up for tests?"

940
00:36:30,714 --> 00:36:32,847
Cockiest son of a bitch I ever saw.

941
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:34,949
But then I really got to know
Mike when we were arguing

942
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,886
over an ethics question in
Professor Gerard's class.

943
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:40,554
Should a lawyer who's crossed a line

944
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,623
be given a second chance?

945
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,892
I didn't think so, but Mike did,

946
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,795
and that's when I realized that
Mike Ross has more integrity

947
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,530
and compassion in his little finger

948
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:51,799
than any other lawyer I've ever met.

949
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,434
And if I was on trial for my life,

950
00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:55,069
there's no one I'd
rather have on my side

951
00:36:55,105 --> 00:36:58,139
than my fellow Harvard alum Mike Ross.

952
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,374
Just so we're 100% clear,

953
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:03,811
was Mike Ross a student at
Harvard Law School with you?

954
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,446
Yes, he was.

955
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:08,916
No further questions, Your Honor.

956
00:37:08,952 --> 00:37:11,452
Now we've heard enough.

957
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:14,488
Ms. Gibbs, I'll give you 24
hours to prepare for cross.

958
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,290
Oh, I don't need 24 hours, Your Honor.

959
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:18,926
Mr. Kirkwood, isn't it
true that two days ago,

960
00:37:18,962 --> 00:37:21,195
Mr. Ross contacted you on
the street outside of your

961
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:23,865
office and the two of you
got into a heated argument?

962
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,234
I have the pictures. Would
you like to see them?

963
00:37:27,403 --> 00:37:29,170
Yes, it's true.

964
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,905
And isn't it also true that Mike Ross

965
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,940
got your aunt a large
settlement several months ago,

966
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:34,408
and if he gets convicted, it's likely

967
00:37:34,443 --> 00:37:36,077
that that settlement gets overturned?

968
00:37:36,112 --> 00:37:37,645
Objection. Calls for speculation.

969
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,613
He's a Harvard lawyer.
He's qualified to speculate.

970
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:41,816
- Overruled.
- No, you're right.

971
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:43,951
It'd probably get overturned,

972
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:45,719
but if you think that's
why I said what I said,

973
00:37:45,755 --> 00:37:47,088
then obviously you don't know me.

974
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:50,091
So Trevor Evans could
lie because he's jealous,

975
00:37:50,126 --> 00:37:51,625
but you wouldn't lie for your aunt?

976
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:52,927
I'm not lying for my aunt.

977
00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:54,996
But you are lying, because a person

978
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:57,231
who's telling the truth wouldn't
say they're lying at all.

979
00:37:57,267 --> 00:37:58,732
Objection. Testifying.

980
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:01,836
You Honor, I've had
enough of this witness.

981
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:03,137
He's excused.

982
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:05,072
And the prosecution rests.

983
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:12,379
Donna.

984
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,547
Come in.

985
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,616
What can I do for you?

986
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:17,018
I'm actually here to see Mike.

987
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:18,052
Mike's not here.

988
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,586
He went to go and see Harvey.

989
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:23,624
- Look, is this about...
- It is about today.

990
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:24,926
Donna, I...

991
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:28,662
You know, I always talk
like nothing can get to me.

992
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:31,032
Well, it did today.

993
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:35,369
I crumbled up there, and
I hurt Mike's case.

994
00:38:35,404 --> 00:38:38,439
And I'm ashamed of myself,
and I don't know what to do.

995
00:38:38,474 --> 00:38:40,541
Okay.

996
00:38:40,576 --> 00:38:42,810
Here's what you're gonna do. It's okay.

997
00:38:42,846 --> 00:38:46,647
You are going to sit down with me

998
00:38:46,682 --> 00:38:50,184
and have a glass of wine

999
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,786
and relax.

1000
00:38:52,822 --> 00:38:55,723
Because juries aren't stupid,
and they aren't allowed

1001
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:59,160
to infer anything from what
you said, so they won't.

1002
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:03,030
Harvey, I got to tell
you, I think we got 'em.

1003
00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:08,602
Mike, sit down.

1004
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,338
What's going on?

1005
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:12,773
We had a good day,
but it wasn't enough.

1006
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,242
What are you talking about?

1007
00:39:14,277 --> 00:39:15,409
- Jimmy came through.
- Mike...

1008
00:39:15,444 --> 00:39:17,378
Look, I know she
landed a punch with him.

1009
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:19,747
And I'm telling you, he wasn't enough.

1010
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:21,849
Harvey, all we need
is reasonable doubt.

1011
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:25,253
And if I was on that
jury, I wouldn't have it.

1012
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:26,587
I'd find you guilty.

1013
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:29,490
That's great.

1014
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:30,992
So you just called me over here

1015
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:32,360
to make me want to kill myself?

1016
00:39:32,395 --> 00:39:36,730
I called you here because
this is not about doubt.

1017
00:39:36,766 --> 00:39:39,500
We need to give them a reason
to want to let you go.

1018
00:39:39,535 --> 00:39:41,269
And how exactly are we gonna do that?

1019
00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:43,637
By doing what you wanted
to do in the first place.

1020
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:47,674
No. Now?

1021
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,876
Are you kidding me?

1022
00:39:48,912 --> 00:39:50,378
It's the only way
to get you to testify

1023
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:51,779
without taking the stand.

1024
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:53,714
And you said if we had to,
we'd put me on the stand.

1025
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:54,848
And you were right.

1026
00:39:54,884 --> 00:39:57,484
She's too good at crossing.

1027
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,753
Well, it's a great idea,
Harvey; I wish I'd had it.

1028
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:01,789
The only problem is, they're
not gonna let me change

1029
00:40:01,824 --> 00:40:03,490
my goddamn lawyer in
the middle of a trial!

1030
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,192
And I'm telling you
we need to figure out

1031
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:07,228
a way to make them.

1032
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:08,396
Because if we don't...

1033
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:10,864
We're gonna lose.

1034
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,882
You're not allowed to talk to me.

1035
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:30,451
That's true,

1036
00:40:30,486 --> 00:40:32,386
but if you don't tell anyone,
then no one's gonna know,

1037
00:40:32,422 --> 00:40:35,556
and I don't think you're
gonna want to tell anyone.

1038
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:38,392
Okay. What do you want?

1039
00:40:38,428 --> 00:40:41,395
I have to admit that until
you got rid of Sheila,

1040
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:43,597
I honestly thought you weren't
part of this whole thing,

1041
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:45,799
but then I did a little checking,

1042
00:40:45,835 --> 00:40:48,302
and I think I can pinpoint the exact day

1043
00:40:48,338 --> 00:40:50,237
you found out about Mike Ross.

1044
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:51,772
I'm calling Jessica.

1045
00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:54,375
They let you resign, you
found out about Mike,

1046
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,510
and you used it to return
as a name partner.

1047
00:40:56,545 --> 00:40:58,179
And you know what that
makes me think about you?

1048
00:40:58,214 --> 00:41:01,215
You're resourceful,
maybe a little sleazy,

1049
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,351
but you didn't hire that
kid in the first place.

1050
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:07,588
I'm not turning on my partners.

1051
00:41:07,623 --> 00:41:11,292
You had to blackmail them
to get what you deserve.

1052
00:41:11,327 --> 00:41:12,860
That's got to stick in your craw.

1053
00:41:12,895 --> 00:41:14,828
- Go.
- I will go, Louis.

1054
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:18,532
But you know what else I found
out when I was looking into you?

1055
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:20,368
You like the ballet.

1056
00:41:20,403 --> 00:41:22,536
You like to go mudding.

1057
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:24,538
You enjoy the creature comforts in life,

1058
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:27,875
but they don't have comforts
like that in prison.

1059
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,310
They're gonna lose this trial.

1060
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:33,280
You know it, I know
it, and they know it.

1061
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:37,251
You have one last chance
to save yourself.

1062
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,086
Think about it.

1063
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,454
And...

1064
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,323
call me.

1065
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:44,125
Before it's too late.

1066
00:41:49,664 --> 00:42:07,146
