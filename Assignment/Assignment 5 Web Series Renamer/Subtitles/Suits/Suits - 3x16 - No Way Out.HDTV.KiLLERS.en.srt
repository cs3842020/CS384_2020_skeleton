1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,774
- I wanna go legit.
- You can't.

2
00:00:02,842 --> 00:00:04,676
Then I get Lola Jensen
to hack into the bar

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,781
and just put me in there
just like she did with Harvard.

4
00:00:06,832 --> 00:00:08,366
Rule number one
of not getting caught,

5
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:09,918
you don't move
the goddamn body.

6
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:11,819
Harvey, I'm stuck.

7
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:14,088
I can't live my whole life
like this.

8
00:00:14,156 --> 00:00:15,457
We're investment bankers.

9
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:17,658
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

10
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,927
Just admit it,
you want me to take the job,

11
00:00:18,994 --> 00:00:20,178
but you're too afraid
to say it.

12
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:21,829
I want you to take the job.

13
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:24,165
You and your associate
conspired with Harold Gunderson

14
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:26,217
to file a lawsuit
against your own clients.

15
00:00:26,302 --> 00:00:27,635
That is a bribe.

16
00:00:27,686 --> 00:00:29,053
Quelling knows
about your bullshit lawsuit

17
00:00:29,138 --> 00:00:30,054
with Harold Gunderson.

18
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:31,639
You need to call
Lola Jensen.

19
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,358
You said it yourself,
hacking into the bar

20
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:35,109
is twice the crime
I've been committing.

21
00:00:35,177 --> 00:00:37,312
I am telling you
Quelling is on the trail,

22
00:00:37,363 --> 00:00:39,113
and you quitting
isn't gonna change that.

23
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:40,315
You're letting Mike
walk out the door

24
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:41,449
without trying to stop him,

25
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:42,784
and anytime I ask you
about anything

26
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:45,737
all you say is,
"I can't talk about it."

27
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:47,355
Mike is gone, Harvey.

28
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:48,523
The jeopardy's gone too.

29
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:49,824
And now you wanna tell someone

30
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,126
who keeps finding a reason
to be pissed at you,

31
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:54,128
and it's not the third time,
and it's not the fifth time,

32
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:55,547
and it's not the last time.

33
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:57,131
You took money
from our client's competitors

34
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,866
to trump up
your bullshit suit.

35
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:00,201
The penalty
is being disbarred.

36
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,554
Being a lawyer
is what I am.

37
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:04,138
And if you take that away--

38
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:05,139
It's up to you.

39
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:06,841
I'll drop the suit.

40
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:09,344
I'm officially a member
of the New York bar.

41
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:10,711
You went to Lola?

42
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:13,515
I want to stay.

43
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:21,573
I'd bring in champagne,

44
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:22,907
but after
all we've been through,

45
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:25,443
I think scotch
seems more appropriate.

46
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:27,445
Does it?

47
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:31,749
Harvey, we've had
this conversation once.

48
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:33,501
If you want someone
who doesn't speak their mind,

49
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,670
I'm not that person.

50
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:36,921
I know.

51
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:40,041
And Mike staying
doesn't change my opinion.

52
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:42,877
Telling Scottie about him
is a mistake.

53
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:45,630
I know.

54
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:47,081
Then why are you
being so quiet?

55
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:49,634
Someone who keeps finding
a way to be pissed at me,

56
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:51,636
and it's not the third time
or the fifth time

57
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,021
or the last time.

58
00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:55,440
- I wasn't gonna say that.
- Yeah, well, you did.

59
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:57,108
Because you forced it
out of me.

60
00:01:57,192 --> 00:02:02,063
Donna, do you want me
and Scottie to succeed or not?

61
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:04,065
I want you to be happy.

62
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:06,117
- That's an evasive answer.
- No, it isn't.

63
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:09,070
Just isn't up to me
to decide what that means.

64
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:15,493
Now are we gonna drink
to Mike staying or what?

65
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,912
Give me that.

66
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:19,998
Not that one.

67
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:21,082
The bigger one.

68
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,283
Seriously?

69
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:37,965
- Hey.
- Hey.

70
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:39,467
I'm so glad you're home.

71
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:41,653
I made dinner
because I want to celebrate.

72
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:45,273
I'm not taking the job.

73
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:46,357
What?

74
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:48,109
I went to see Harvey,

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,311
and, um...

76
00:02:50,362 --> 00:02:52,413
I told him that I'm staying.

77
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:58,252
What about the fact
that it was eating you up?

78
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,321
Look, Rachel, I know
this isn't what you wanted.

79
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:01,489
What I wanted?

80
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,341
I didn't wanna give you
my opinion at all,

81
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:04,709
but you forced it out of me,

82
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:06,878
and then you told me that you
were gonna take the job.

83
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:07,962
Okay, Rachel--

84
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:09,213
No, and now
you come in here,

85
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:10,598
and you tell me
you're gonna stay a fraud.

86
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,350
- A lawyer.
- A fraud.

87
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:17,772
What happened
to accepting me for who I am?

88
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:20,475
What happened
to you taking the job?

89
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:26,447
It was a way out.

90
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:28,533
You said you were afraid
if you told me your opinion,

91
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:30,234
I'd hold it against you,

92
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,072
but now that I'm not doing
what you told me to,

93
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:35,289
you're holding it
against me.

94
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:36,290
I am.

95
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:37,709
Yeah, that's not fair.

96
00:03:37,793 --> 00:03:39,577
I wanna know what changed

97
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:41,529
from when you told me you were
gonna take the job to now.

98
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,864
I went to see Quelling.

99
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,049
He once had
an offer on the table

100
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:47,135
that would change his life,

101
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:48,469
and he turned it down

102
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:51,472
because he wanted to do
what was right for his clients.

103
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,808
Cost him everything.

104
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,426
The only thing
it didn't cost him

105
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:57,378
was his ability
to practice law.

106
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:58,980
And I didn't want
to take it away from him

107
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:00,047
just like I don't wanna
take it away from me.

108
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:01,099
Mike.

109
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:04,268
You said that staying
is eating me up,

110
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:07,155
but the thought of going
is eating me up more.

111
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,527
I'm just--I'm not ready
to leave, Rachel.

112
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:20,234
Thanks.

113
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:21,836
Michael Ross.

114
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:23,004
Yes?

115
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:25,673
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

116
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:26,791
Who's "we"?

117
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:30,044
The U.S. attorney's office.

118
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,463
What can I help you with?

119
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:36,801
We'd prefer to have
this conversation in private.

120
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,889
- Prefer?
- Insist.

121
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:53,067
Scottie.

122
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:55,820
I know we got in a fight,

123
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:58,990
but drinking before 10:00 a.m.,
is that really the answer?

124
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:02,276
It is on <i>Mad Men.</i>

125
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:05,780
Who's that guy
think he is anyway?

126
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,116
Mike's staying.

127
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:11,753
You must be happy.

128
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:13,454
I am.

129
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:18,059
Scottie, I'm gonna do better
about being open with you.

130
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:21,462
Good.

131
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:25,149
Are we good?

132
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:26,467
We're good.

133
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:28,519
Then let's go out tonight
and have some fun.

134
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:30,855
I'm in.

135
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:39,580
Scottie.

136
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:40,665
Yeah?

137
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:45,586
Let's go somewhere new.

138
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:51,459
Donna, I don't wanna hear it.

139
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,627
I didn't tell her
about Mike.

140
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:54,095
Harvey, Stephanie Liston
just called me.

141
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:57,331
Your friend
from the U.S. Attorney's office?

142
00:05:57,382 --> 00:06:00,000
She said they just brought
Mike in for questioning.

143
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:05,973
Mr. Ross, Eric Woodall.

144
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:07,475
I'm the U.S. attorney--

145
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:08,810
For the Southern district
of New York.

146
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:10,228
Yeah, I know who you are.

147
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:13,030
Then you know
you're in a shitload of trouble.

148
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:16,367
You wanna come clean,
or should I lay it out for you?

149
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:18,091
I don't know
what you're talking about.

150
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,071
You conspired
with Harold Gunderson,

151
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:21,989
to defraud
the United States government

152
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,793
by paying off witnesses
against Ava Hessington.

153
00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:28,129
What?

154
00:06:28,196 --> 00:06:30,131
You sound surprised.

155
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:31,749
I am
because it's bullshit.

156
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,718
It's not bullshit.

157
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:36,220
You're facing some major
prison time, my friend.

158
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:37,922
- I'm not your friend.
- You can be.

159
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,423
Pass.

160
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:41,893
I settled a lawsuit, okay?
I didn't do anything wrong.

161
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:44,478
Hey, I don't think you did.

162
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:46,731
Well, not on your own anyway.

163
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:49,216
Is there a question?

164
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:50,384
Come on,
you're a bright young man.

165
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:52,386
You see where I'm going.

166
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:55,156
I don't want the dealer.

167
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:57,074
I want the supplier.

168
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,026
Harvey Specter.

169
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:03,781
Roll over on him,
I'll cut a deal right now.

180
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:45,247
Harvey Specter.
I represent Mike Ross.

181
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,581
Sir, you can't
go back there.

182
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,466
Sir!

183
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,340
Well, hey there.

184
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:57,592
Are you charging him?

185
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,394
- Not at the moment.
- Then he's coming with me.

186
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:00,979
And you had no right
to bring him in.

187
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,764
I had every right
to bring him in,

188
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,066
but it doesn't matter
'cause he came in voluntarily.

189
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:06,484
And he's leaving
immediately.

190
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,069
We were just having
a friendly conversation

191
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:09,521
about the witnesses
who suddenly fell out

192
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:12,490
of the Ava Hessington case.

193
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,359
Seems your associate
was a little chummy

194
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,578
with the associate
at Bratton Gould.

195
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:19,614
Harvey Gunderson,
I think, is his name.

196
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,284
Harold Gunderson.

197
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,336
You're right.

198
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,254
You're Harvey.

199
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:27,956
I gotta keep this
all straight in my head

200
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,457
before I make my case.

201
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,843
Because once
we bring Harold in,

202
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,428
he'll point
the finger at Mike,

203
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:35,013
who will then
have no choice

204
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,499
but to bring it right home
to you, Harvey.

205
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,353
I promise I won't forget
your name again.

206
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,939
Open that door.

207
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:50,862
Good talking to you, Mike.
Hope it's the first of many.

208
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,232
Jessica,
I have some dire news.

209
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:56,034
I was just walking
by the conference room,

210
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,286
and I saw Max Pollard
sitting there all by himself.

211
00:08:58,354 --> 00:08:59,520
Harvey was a no-show?

212
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,789
Don't worry,
I took care of everything,

213
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,907
but it's not like Harvey
to miss a meeting.

214
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:04,542
Thank you, Louis.
I'll look into it.

215
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,744
You see,
that's just it.

216
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,695
I think something
might be wrong with him.

217
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,581
You mean like he's a spy?

218
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,416
No, Jessica, listen.

219
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,201
Ever since my heart attack,

220
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,552
I've been worrying
about other people's health.

221
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,137
And I'd ask Donna,
but I don't wanna burden her

222
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:17,505
with the knowledge
of his mortality.

223
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:19,307
You don't think
Donna knows Harvey can die?

224
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,592
Look, Jessica, I know

225
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:22,877
Harvey appears to be lean
and relatively fit,

226
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,063
but coronary disease can strike
even the most handsome.

227
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,514
Louis, listen to me.

228
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:29,184
Harvey isn't sick.
He didn't have a heart attack.

229
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,435
And if he missed
that meeting,

230
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,822
I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

231
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:34,939
I'm sure you're right.

232
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:36,074
I'm gonna go check
my blood pressure.

233
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,243
Oh, good idea.

234
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:47,919
Where the hell is Harvey?

235
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,421
Is he supposed to be
somewhere he's not?

236
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,007
Donna, no games.

237
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:53,875
He missed a meeting
with a longtime client,

238
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,378
so either you screwed up,
which you never do,

239
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,130
or there's an emergency
I'm not being told about.

240
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:00,181
Both.

241
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,133
Meaning?

242
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,585
I forgot
to cancel that meeting

243
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,271
because there's
an emergency.

244
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:06,221
What is it?

245
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,894
Mike Ross got called in
for questioning this morning.

246
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,449
Sorry about this, Harvey.

247
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,117
Could have been worse.

248
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,902
You thought they had me
for being a fraud?

249
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,120
Well, I didn't think
they had you

250
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,738
for overdue library books.

251
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,457
Why'd you go with them
in the first place?

252
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,791
Didn't your grandmother
ever teach you

253
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,326
not to get into cars
with strangers?

254
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,577
I was being cooperative.

255
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,663
Well, don't do that again.

256
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:33,214
Goddamn Quelling.

257
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:34,466
He didn't just
hand us to the bar.

258
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,134
He went
to the Justice Department.

259
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,502
I can't believe it.

260
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:39,337
I looked him in the eye.
He gave me his word.

261
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:42,006
Screw that guy.
I'm turning him into the bar.

262
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,975
Right now
he's not our problem.

263
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,427
Harold is.

264
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,561
No, I'm gonna talk to him.

265
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:48,263
Not a chance.

266
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,464
Harvey, they haven't
brought him in yet.

267
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,398
All I need
is five minutes to tell him--

268
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:51,799
To stick to your story?

269
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,069
That's exactly why they
haven't brought him in yet.

270
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,487
You talk to Harold,

271
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,804
they'll be watching,
we'll be done.

272
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,573
If we don't talk to him
before this Woodall guy

273
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,141
gets him in the room,
we're in deep shit.

274
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,194
Then we need to talk to him
without talking to him.

275
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,508
Allison Holt.

276
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,177
Harvey Specter.

277
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,796
Can't say I'm surprised
to see you.

278
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,998
So I assume that means you've
spoken to the U.S. Attorney.

279
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:25,133
I have.

280
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,184
Then I suggest
we make sure

281
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,385
we're on the same page.

282
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,304
Unlike you,
I don't automatically

283
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,107
protect someone who may have
jeopardized my firm.

284
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:34,642
What exactly did you say
when Woodall came to you?

285
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,728
He didn't come to me.
I went to him.

286
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:38,113
What?

287
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,697
A man named James Quelling
came at me,

288
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,117
questioning the settlement
between Harold Gunderson,

289
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:44,452
Mike Ross,
and your murder witnesses.

290
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,571
So you go straight
to the U.S. Attorney?

291
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:47,705
My integrity was questioned.

292
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,957
First step
isn't to go to the person

293
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,209
I'm accused of colluding with
to cover it up.

294
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,693
Answer me one thing--

295
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,546
does Harold Gunderson know
what's going on?

296
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,663
I don't know
what he knows,

297
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,882
and, frankly,
I don't care.

298
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,885
I fired Harold Gunderson
an hour ago.

299
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,761
Can I talk to you
for a second?

300
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:12,597
Of course.

301
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,053
I just got
taken downtown.

302
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:20,555
What?

303
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,324
The U.S. Attorney's office
brought me in for questioning.

304
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:27,445
I thought it was about me,
but it wasn't.

305
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,563
Thank God.

306
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,831
No, Rachel,
it's still bad.

307
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:31,032
They're looking
into the settlement

308
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,117
that I made with Harold
before Ava's trial.

309
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:35,336
That deal
wasn't exactly legitimate.

310
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:38,923
And they want me
to turn on Harvey.

311
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,508
I knew you should have
taken that job.

312
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:41,593
This has nothing
to do with that.

313
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,594
Doesn't it?

314
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,095
If you weren't working here,

315
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,247
they wouldn't be able
to use your relationship

316
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,432
with Harvey as leverage.

317
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,683
You think
I would turn my back on him

318
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,351
even if I wasn't
working here?

319
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:51,919
I don't think you'd ever
turn your back on Harvey.

320
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,271
That's the problem.

321
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,807
- What does that mean?
- Harvey wanted you to stay.

322
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:57,775
I wanted you to leave.
You chose to stay.

323
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,278
So your priorities,
they seem pretty clear to me.

324
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,148
- Rachel, come on.
- Hey, wait a minute

325
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:05,433
if they charge you
with something,

326
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,651
they're gonna go
through your records,

327
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,119
and they are going
to realize

328
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,122
that you're not
a member of the bar.

329
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,159
No, they won't.

330
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:25,136
What are you talking about?

331
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,838
I had Lola Jensen
hack into the bar

332
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:30,308
and put me
in their records.

333
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,894
And when were
you going to tell me?

334
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:34,512
I was going to tell you
everything last night,

335
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:36,481
but you didn't exactly seem
like you were in the mood.

336
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,967
Oh, I'm not
in the mood right now either.

337
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,185
I am gonna go outside
and get some air.

338
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,737
Why don't you just stay here
and figure out

339
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:44,072
if there's some other crime
you can commit

340
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:47,325
to get out of this one?

341
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,792
You should have called me
the minute this went down.

342
00:13:57,877 --> 00:13:59,010
There wasn't time.

343
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:00,612
You had time
to see Allison Holt.

344
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,280
I was trying to get
out in front of it.

345
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:04,432
Allison Holt
isn't our problem.

346
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:05,934
Mike Ross is.

347
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:07,268
The U.S. Attorney
keeps poking around,

348
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:08,887
he's gonna find out
that his star witness

349
00:14:08,938 --> 00:14:11,439
isn't even in the bar.
No, he won't.

350
00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:13,641
If they look in the bar,
they'll find Mike Ross

351
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:16,728
listed as a member.

352
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,980
You had him
commit another felony?

353
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:20,648
You want me
to say that out loud?

354
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:23,935
No, I don't.

355
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:25,703
I'd rather get back
to the matter at hand.

356
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:28,123
We need to make sure
Harold Gunderson doesn't talk.

357
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:29,407
Then you need
to learn more

358
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,042
about the man
who's trying to make him talk,

359
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,129
because he's coming for you,
and you don't know who he is,

360
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:35,580
what he'll do,
or what he's got.

361
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:36,881
I know one thing--

362
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:38,116
if he had
any kind of proof,

363
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,251
someone here would have
already been arrested.

364
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:43,287
Arrested?
For what?

365
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:44,973
We're being investigated
for the settlement

366
00:14:45,057 --> 00:14:47,675
between us and Bratton Gould
in the Hessington case.

367
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,893
Quelling didn't go away?

368
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:50,478
Quelling threatened
to go to the bar.

369
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:53,348
This is
the U.S. Attorney's office.

370
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:56,434
Well, that only matters
if the allegations have merit.

371
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:00,304
I never thought
I would have to ask this,

372
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:02,440
but do the allegations
have merit?

373
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:03,641
We're handling this,
Scottie.

374
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:04,943
I didn't ask
who was handling it.

375
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:08,446
I asked
if they have merit.

376
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,087
Scottie.
Scottie.

377
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:17,321
What, are you
gonna be charming?

378
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:19,090
Quote a TV show?

379
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:20,491
What happened to
"I'm going to do better"?

380
00:15:20,543 --> 00:15:22,427
God damn it,
I'm trying.

381
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:24,796
Harvey, I don't think you
understand what trying means.

382
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:26,714
You know what, Scottie?
You keep on thinking

383
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,383
that there are things
being withheld from you, but--

384
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:30,718
But what?
It's just business?

385
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:33,221
- It is just business.
- Fine.

386
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:35,273
As a senior partner,
I want to know

387
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,392
if this firm outright
broke any laws.

388
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:39,110
- Harvey, I need to talk to you.
- Not now, Donna.

389
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:41,112
If you want me
to talk to Stephanie,

390
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,847
you have to tell me what you
want me to ask her right now.

391
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,652
I guess it's
"not now, Scottie."

392
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:53,291
Mike. Mike.
I need to talk to you.

393
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:54,576
No, no, I can't
even be seen with you.

394
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,161
Go, now.
But you have to talk to me.

395
00:15:56,212 --> 00:15:58,196
Allison Holt
just fired me out of the blue.

396
00:15:58,247 --> 00:15:59,864
I'm freaking out, man.
Harold, listen to me.

397
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,049
You have to calm down,
all right?

398
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,700
Harold Gunderson,
you're not welcome here.

399
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:04,169
You know what, Louis?

400
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,503
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now, so--

401
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:07,639
Well, I don't give a shit.
Mike, do me a favor.

402
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:11,309
Do not let this unappreciative
ex-employee into our offices.

403
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:13,978
Harold, you have to go,
right now.

404
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:16,014
No, wait, Mike.
Please.

405
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:17,932
I got a call
from the U.S. Attorney's office

406
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:19,651
asking for me to come in.

407
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:21,069
Somehow,
they're onto what we did,

408
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:22,070
and I think we need to--
Harold, Harold, Harold.

409
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:23,688
Harold.

410
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:25,490
All I know
about that settlement

411
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:28,326
is that you stuck it to us
because you saw the chance

412
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:29,661
to get back at us
for firing you.

413
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:30,745
Mike, that's not true.

414
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:32,780
I don't want
to hear it, Harold.

415
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:34,449
What you did
was harsh and vindictive,

416
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:37,919
but it was completely legal
because you initiated it.

417
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:39,787
And nobody can prove
anything other than that

418
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:42,540
as long as we both
remember it.

419
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,712
- I lost my job, Mike.
- I'm sorry about that, Harold.

420
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:50,515
I wish there was something
I could do.

421
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:52,016
Now I have to go back inside.

422
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:54,018
Michael Ross,
Harold Gunderson,

423
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:55,220
you're under arrest
for conspiracy

424
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:58,756
to defraud
the United States government.

425
00:17:10,653 --> 00:17:12,787
Hey.
Thanks for meeting with me.

426
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:14,622
Donna, you can thank me
all you want.

427
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:16,407
I don't know anything
about Eric Woodall.

428
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,608
Stephanie, come on.

429
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,327
You know everything that goes on
in that office.

430
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:21,663
You just don't want
to tell me.

431
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:23,164
What do you want
to know?

432
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:25,416
Well, how about we start with
why he's coming after Harvey?

433
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:27,635
Because he hates
dirty lawyers.

434
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,387
He thinks
they're the scum of the earth.

435
00:17:29,454 --> 00:17:30,972
And Harvey got
on his radar?

436
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:33,341
And the reason
Woodall's not on your radar

437
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:36,644
is because the last case he won
took him four years.

438
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:38,680
So you're saying
he'll stop at nothing?

439
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,431
Not that I've ever seen.

440
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:41,733
Then we need
to know what he's got.

441
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,101
No way.

442
00:17:43,152 --> 00:17:44,969
I called you
when they brought your guy in.

443
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,854
I could lose my job
for that as it is.

444
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:49,807
You have something else a lot
more important than your job,

445
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:51,609
thanks to me.

446
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,578
When are you gonna stop
holding that over my head?

447
00:17:53,645 --> 00:17:56,914
In another 30 seconds if you
tell me what I need to know.

448
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:00,318
Okay.

449
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:02,203
He's got nothing.

450
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:05,123
But the thing is,
he wins with nothing.

451
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:07,458
You just said
he hates dirty lawyers,

452
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:10,428
and now you're saying
he'll break the law?

453
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:12,830
He may, he may not.

454
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:15,967
But he'll definitely
bend the shit out of it.

455
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:19,003
I want to know
what's going on.

456
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:20,221
I told you
what's going on.

457
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:22,190
Harvey and I are taking care
of a situation.

458
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:25,193
That's a bullshit answer,
and you know it.

459
00:18:25,277 --> 00:18:27,645
I don't know how it went
with you and Edward Darby,

460
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:29,480
but you come into my office
with that attitude,

461
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:31,699
and it won't go well
for you with me.

462
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:32,850
My attitude comes
from the fact

463
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:33,951
that I worked
for Edward Darby.

464
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,320
I don't want to work
for another one.

465
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:37,655
You're way out of line.

466
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:39,957
Your name is not
on the door here.

467
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:41,409
No, but if this all comes down
because of something

468
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:42,877
you and Harvey did,
I'm tainted by it.

469
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:47,048
Then walk away, Scottie.
I'm not stopping you.

470
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:49,050
No, the noncompete
you had me sign is stopping me.

471
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:51,336
Is that
what's stopping you?

472
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:53,588
Jessica, I moved my life
back to New York.

473
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:55,256
I don't want
to move again.

474
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:57,592
So I'm asking you
one more time--

475
00:18:57,676 --> 00:19:00,228
what is going on?

476
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:07,485
What's going on,

477
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:09,237
is you and Harvey
made an impulsive deal

478
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:10,855
for you to come here,

479
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:12,106
and clearly,
it's not working out,

480
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:13,741
or you'd be having
this conversation

481
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:16,227
with him and not me.

482
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:22,867
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

483
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:24,369
I've been in here
for two hours.

484
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,569
You said I was under arrest,

485
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:29,407
but I still haven't
been processed.

486
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,242
I demand to call Harvey.

487
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:34,295
Sorry, we can't have that.

488
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,297
Then I guess you can't have
a guilty verdict against me

489
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:38,633
or anybody else,
because I know my rights.

490
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:40,685
Well, I'm afraid
your rights have run

491
00:19:40,752 --> 00:19:43,688
smack into a little something
called the Patriot Act.

492
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:44,939
Whatever bullshit
you're trying to pull

493
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,724
only applies to terrorists.

494
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,276
Then it's a good thing
there are allegations

495
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,396
of terrorism against
those Hessington witnesses.

496
00:19:56,785 --> 00:19:59,120
You're not gonna
get away with this.

497
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:01,406
I'm not getting away
with anything.

498
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:05,243
I'm just being thorough by
looking into these allegations.

499
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:06,461
Try to be patient.

500
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:07,912
Maybe, uh,
think about the fact

501
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:10,465
that Harold Gunderson
is trying to be patient

502
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:13,334
right next door.

503
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:28,295
Pacing.
Right on schedule.

504
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:30,297
First sign that a man
is losing it.

505
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:32,049
It's called walking.

506
00:20:32,116 --> 00:20:33,300
You can call it
what you want.

507
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:34,468
I know what I'm looking at.

508
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:36,470
Yeah.
So do I.

509
00:20:36,554 --> 00:20:38,621
A guy who looked
into those terrorist allegations

510
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:40,340
and came up with nothing.

511
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:42,476
I'll admit the rumors
about those witnesses

512
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,928
were unsubstantiated.

513
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,813
But I'd be negligent
if I didn't look

514
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:50,967
into an American with ties
to such questionable characters.

515
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:53,320
And you never know
what a thorough background check

516
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:57,357
is gonna turn up.

517
00:20:57,442 --> 00:20:58,775
Then go ahead.

518
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:00,477
Do your background check,
so I can get out of here,

519
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:03,530
because all this is doing
is making me bored.

520
00:21:03,614 --> 00:21:05,782
Well, I can take care
of that for you.

521
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,785
Why don't I let you watch
a little TV?

522
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:19,379
Now, that's pacing.

523
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:30,273
Did you find out anything
useful on Eric Woodall?

524
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:33,143
I found out we need
to start going on offense.

525
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:34,811
How?

526
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:36,480
Donna's having Mike compile
every piece of communication

527
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:37,864
during that settlement
to prove

528
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:40,317
Harold contacted us first,
not the other way around.

529
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:42,986
- Is that true?
- You really want to know?

530
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:44,571
After that,
we're gonna read up

531
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:47,324
on every tactic Woodall used
in his last case.

532
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,325
Case?

533
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:50,410
Took him four years.

534
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:51,995
Dog with a bone.

535
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:53,997
That's why we're going
on offense.

536
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,917
Well, I found out
something too.

537
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:59,386
Scottie wants to leave.

538
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,754
What?

539
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:04,040
She asked out
of her noncompete.

540
00:22:04,092 --> 00:22:05,475
And what did you say?

541
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:07,761
I said I had to discuss it
with my partner.

542
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:10,514
It would have been nice if she
discussed it with her partner.

543
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:14,317
She accused me
of some pretty shady shit.

544
00:22:14,385 --> 00:22:15,852
And she's right.

545
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:17,904
What are you talking about?

546
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:20,857
I told you earlier,

547
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:23,860
I didn't want
to know about Mike and the bar,

548
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:25,362
and just now, you asked me
if I wanted to know

549
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,414
about Mike and Harold,
and again,

550
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:29,950
I didn't want to know.

551
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:33,753
And "I don't want to know" is
exactly what Edward Darby said.

552
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:37,257
We're not him.

553
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:39,376
Edward Darby didn't
commit those murders.

554
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:40,877
He just covered them up.

555
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:43,913
And it seems to me
we keep doing things,

556
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:47,417
and then we have to keep
covering them up.

557
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:50,053
We're not him.

558
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:51,304
Harvey.

559
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:55,559
What do you want me
to tell Scottie?

560
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,060
If she doesn't want
to be here,

561
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:59,429
let her go.

562
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:07,204
What the hell
did you do?

563
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:08,321
You know what I did.

564
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:09,573
I handed you in
to the bar.

565
00:23:09,624 --> 00:23:11,158
Mike Ross and I
had a deal.

566
00:23:11,242 --> 00:23:13,443
Yeah, well, that deal
went away when he got brought in

567
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:15,629
for questioning
by the U.S. Attorney.

568
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:17,214
What?
That wasn't me.

569
00:23:17,281 --> 00:23:18,582
I didn't go to them.

570
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:19,949
I don't give a shit
if you went to them or not.

571
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,885
This whole thing started
when you walked into my office

572
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:24,137
with a lawsuit
you were bribed to create.

573
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:25,972
And after that,
I made a deal with Mike.

574
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:27,390
And I held
to my end of the bargain.

575
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,842
Maybe you didn't hear me.

576
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:30,727
That deal went away
when they picked him up,

577
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:32,679
hauled him in,
and then tried to get him

578
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:34,064
to turn on me.

579
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:35,182
Well, you can still
stop this.

580
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:37,150
Yeah, well,
I'm not going to.

581
00:23:37,235 --> 00:23:39,269
Well, then you better look
over your shoulder every day

582
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,239
for the rest
of your natural-born life.

583
00:23:42,306 --> 00:23:45,242
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

584
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:48,495
Listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

585
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:50,647
You pulled out a gun
and threatened to shoot my guy,

586
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:52,249
and I don't give a shit
if you didn't mean to shoot it,

587
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:54,000
because it went off.

588
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:56,703
They're looking into me
because of you.

589
00:23:56,787 --> 00:23:59,155
And I ever so much
as hear your name again,

590
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:01,841
I will find you, and I will
break every bone in your body.

591
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:04,594
You are nothing
but a badass on his high horse.

592
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:06,596
Well, Mr. badass,
I may have started them

593
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:07,714
looking into what you did,

594
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:08,848
but you were the one
who did it.

595
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:10,884
Quelling,
be on your way.

596
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:27,284
- Rachel, have you seen Mike?
- No, Louis, I haven't.

597
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:29,402
Okay.
Is something wrong?

598
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:30,403
Yeah, something's wrong.
We got into a fight.

599
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:31,854
I haven't seen him since.

600
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:33,323
Well, I haven't seen him
since he was talking to Harold,

601
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:34,857
but I need him to give me--
He was talking to Harold?

602
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,126
Yeah, I don't know,
they were having

603
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:37,460
some idiotic fight outside.
Why?

604
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:38,628
No, it's nothing.
I have to go talk to Harvey.

605
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:41,581
Whoa, wait a second.
Harvey?

606
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:43,250
Does this have something to do
with why he missed his meeting

607
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:44,384
this morning?
I can't.

608
00:24:44,468 --> 00:24:46,086
Rachel.

609
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,838
You need to tell me what
the hell's going on right now.

610
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:54,561
Donna, I know you saw
what happened in the lobby.

611
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:55,645
I don't want
to hear about it.

612
00:24:55,713 --> 00:24:56,763
Harvey, I can't find Mike.

613
00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:58,148
What?

614
00:24:58,215 --> 00:25:00,150
I've tried his email,
I've tried texting,

615
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:01,351
I've looked everywhere.

616
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:03,403
I'm telling you,
Mike is nowhere to be found.

617
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:04,938
- Louis, not now.
- Yes, now, Harvey.

618
00:25:05,022 --> 00:25:07,390
I know where he is.

619
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:10,527
He's under arrest,
along with Harold Gunderson.

620
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:13,413
We need to get down there
right now.

621
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:15,248
Let me get this straight.

622
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,916
You two were
in a heated conversation

623
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,535
when we picked you up,

624
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,337
and that had nothing
to do with this.

625
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:22,422
It had everything
to do with it.

626
00:25:22,506 --> 00:25:24,007
You mean you were
trying to cover your tracks.

627
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:26,126
No, we were having
a heated conversation

628
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,628
about what bullshit charges
these are.

629
00:25:28,713 --> 00:25:31,097
Okay, I'm done
playing your games.

630
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:33,916
He was your only friend
at that firm, you got fired.

631
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:35,435
You got him another job,

632
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,104
and that's why you went to him
to set this whole thing up.

633
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:39,556
You've got
your information wrong.

634
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:41,107
He wasn't my friend.

635
00:25:41,192 --> 00:25:42,525
I had the chance
to save his job...

636
00:25:42,593 --> 00:25:44,861
But instead,
he threw me under the bus.

637
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:47,063
That is why I instituted
this lawsuit.

638
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:50,099
So you can take your bullshit
allegations somewhere else

639
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:51,951
because I am not
gonna roll on Harvey.

640
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:53,536
I'm not rolling on Mike.

641
00:25:53,604 --> 00:25:57,824
And Harold is not
gonna roll on me.

642
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:01,127
You guys
are well rehearsed.

643
00:26:01,212 --> 00:26:02,662
So I'll ask you again,

644
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:05,498
is that what you were doing
on the street today?

645
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:11,171
Jesus Christ, you know,
you drive like my Nana--

646
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:12,839
he drives like my Nana,
and she's 102.

647
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:14,424
Relax, Louis.
Ray's on it.

648
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:16,593
Nobody's
getting us there faster.

649
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:17,927
I mean, I can't believe
this whole thing's been going on

650
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:19,179
and I've been
completely out of the loop.

651
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:20,513
Louis, I don't want
to rehash it.

652
00:26:20,598 --> 00:26:21,848
Right now,
Mike's in custody.

653
00:26:21,932 --> 00:26:23,183
We need to get him out.

654
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:26,019
Yeah, and you need to tell me
what the hell happened.

655
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:27,303
Are you asking
if we broke the law

656
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:29,272
when we made
that settlement with Harold?

657
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:33,243
That's exactly
what I'm asking.

658
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,245
We have exposure.

659
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:40,033
Well, then you better hope
that Ray drives

660
00:26:40,117 --> 00:26:42,752
a little goddamn faster,
because you and I both know

661
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,754
what's going on in there.

662
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,317
Let me tell what
we're dealing with here.

663
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:56,382
Conspiring to bribe witnesses--
seven years.

664
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:59,602
You filed a sworn declaration
in support of your suit.

665
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:02,388
That's perjury--
another two years.

666
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,723
And to top it all off,

667
00:27:03,774 --> 00:27:05,391
the money was
transferred overseas,

668
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:08,110
which would be--

669
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:12,398
well, you're a lawyer.
Fill in the blank.

670
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:14,317
- Wire fraud.
- Bingo.

671
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:17,937
Big winner.
And your prize is 20 more years.

672
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:21,324
And here's the thing.
I am gonna make sure

673
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:23,075
that it's not
a cushy white-collar prison.

674
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:26,278
This is just ridiculous.

675
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,447
If Harold isn't broken by now,
I'll shit my pants.

676
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:30,166
If Harold's broken,
then when we get there,

677
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:34,153
Mike's gonna be
on his way to prison.

678
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:36,889
Someone needs to get in there
and hold his hand.

679
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:38,674
Not someone...

680
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:41,060
You.
Are you serious?

681
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,311
I'm the last person
in the world

682
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:45,130
that Harold Gunderson
wants to see right now.

683
00:27:45,182 --> 00:27:47,266
Louis,
when we were associates,

684
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:48,901
who did you fear most?

685
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:51,237
That's easy.
My mother.

686
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:54,774
I meant in the firm.

687
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:56,308
Daniel Hardman.

688
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,326
So who would you most
want to come in

689
00:27:57,411 --> 00:27:59,161
and take on Eric Woodall,

690
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:02,164
if you were in that room?

691
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:03,833
- Daniel Hardman.
- Exactly.

692
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:05,534
Look, Harold may not like you,

693
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:08,004
but he respects you,
and he's all alone.

694
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:09,288
Now, when we get there,

695
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,290
I need you to channel
your inner Hardman,

696
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,541
get him to trust you,

697
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:16,161
and then shut him
the hell up.

698
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,503
Can I talk to you
for a second?

699
00:28:24,554 --> 00:28:25,771
You look concerned.

700
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:33,846
Do you know why I never batted
an eye when I found out

701
00:28:33,897 --> 00:28:36,115
Harvey had hired a kid
who didn't go to law school?

702
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:38,818
Because you're loyal to him.

703
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:41,537
Because I knew
what was inside him.

704
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:43,289
And I thought if he had
a protege--

705
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:45,992
He could have hired
a protege from Harvard.

706
00:28:46,043 --> 00:28:49,128
But he wouldn't have been
forced to protect him.

707
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:52,465
And he wouldn't have become
the man he is today.

708
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:56,502
Well, now that protege is
in trouble.

709
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:00,923
They have Mike
and Harold Gunderson in custody.

710
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,209
Then Harvey's
in trouble too.

711
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:06,211
No.

712
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:08,047
Mike would never
turn on Harvey.

713
00:29:08,098 --> 00:29:10,066
You never know
what might happen to a person

714
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,852
once they get
in that room.

715
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:16,822
Not now, Scottie.

716
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,223
Donna, I'm just writing him

717
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:21,444
a note telling him
I wanted to talk.

718
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:23,446
"To talk."

719
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:28,034
I don't think you know how hard
he's trying.

720
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:30,402
I know he's trying.

721
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:32,237
I'm just not sure
that it's good enough.

722
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:33,672
You knew
who he was, Scottie.

723
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,125
- And I thought he would change.
- I think he has changed,

724
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,126
and if it's not enough
for you, then--

725
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,344
That's not the problem.

726
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:39,929
I think that he's changed
too much,

727
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:43,466
and I think it happened
before I got back.

728
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,184
He's a good man, Scottie,

729
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:48,604
but he's not perfect.

730
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:50,723
Sometimes you just have to take
what you get,

731
00:29:50,774 --> 00:29:53,025
or walk away.

732
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:04,487
You know, they did
an experiment a few years back.

733
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:06,822
Took five mice,
put 'em in a cage,

734
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:11,077
fed them just enough to survive,
and you know what happened?

735
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:14,279
One by one,
they cornered the weakest mouse

736
00:30:14,331 --> 00:30:17,633
and ate him alive.

737
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:20,586
You know what you're gonna be
when you get to prison, Mike?

738
00:30:20,637 --> 00:30:22,922
The weakest mouse.
Bullshit.

739
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:24,957
They have done studies,
and I've read them,

740
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:26,225
and that's not what happens.

741
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,761
The only way a mouse
eats one of his own

742
00:30:28,812 --> 00:30:31,313
is if he's been contaminated
by another species.

743
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,817
Yeah, you're right.
It's bullshit.

744
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:37,469
But you know who believed it
when I told it to him,

745
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:38,687
five minutes ago?

746
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:41,807
Harold.

747
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:55,204
Looks like you're out of time.
Harold's ready to talk.

748
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,925
You want to tell me
something first?

749
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:12,688
Get to him
before he changes his mind.

750
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:17,193
- I demand to see my client.
- You can see him,

751
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:19,395
but I'm not letting him go,
'cause in five minutes,

752
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:22,481
I'm gonna come back to him
with a sledgehammer.

753
00:31:26,236 --> 00:31:28,204
Not so fast.

754
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:29,705
I demand to see my client,

755
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:33,209
and my client isn't Mike Ross,
it's Harold Gunderson.

756
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:36,028
- And you are?
- Louis Litt, Pearson Specter.

757
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:39,531
You're telling me that a man
who works at the law firm

758
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:43,219
he's accused of colluding with
just happens to be his attorney?

759
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:44,553
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

760
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:46,038
- Bullshit.
- No.

761
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:47,756
What's bullshit is you thinking
it's up to you

762
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:50,309
who gets to represent
Harold Gunderson.

763
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:51,727
So if I walk in there
right now

764
00:31:51,811 --> 00:31:53,479
and ask him who his attorney is,
he's gonna say it's you?

765
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:54,880
Doesn't matter
what he says.

766
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:57,850
It's 4:07, and if
you don't let me see my client,

767
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:00,486
anything he says after this
second will be inadmissible.

768
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:02,521
And I will rain down
fourth amendment claims on you

769
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:05,741
for the rest
of your goddamn life.

770
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:10,829
If you wanted some me time,
all you had to do was ask.

771
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:12,364
You'd better have
some good news for me,

772
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:14,200
otherwise I'm gonna be having
plenty of me time.

773
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:17,736
Harvey, this Woodall guy
is serious.

774
00:32:17,787 --> 00:32:20,739
- I'm serious too.
- Then why am I still in here?

775
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,925
Because we're waiting
for Louis.

776
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,843
Louis?
To do what?

777
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:28,130
Convince Harold not to talk.

778
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:30,516
Holy shit.
Louis is in with Harold?

779
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:31,884
Harold hates Louis!

780
00:32:31,935 --> 00:32:34,687
It's our best shot.

781
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:40,776
So what do we do now?

782
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,146
We wait.

783
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:51,654
Louis, what are you
doing here?

784
00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:52,871
First off, how you doing?

785
00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:54,490
How do you think I'm doing?

786
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:57,459
I'm in the seventh circle
of hell.

787
00:32:57,544 --> 00:32:59,078
Well, the cavalry
has arrived.

788
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:02,498
I don't need the cavalry.
I've decided to get out.

789
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:04,449
Okay, Harold,
you cannot sign a deal.

790
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,285
You'll never work
as a lawyer again.

791
00:33:06,336 --> 00:33:08,971
What do you care?
You fired me as a lawyer.

792
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,289
Now all of a sudden
you're my best friend

793
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,975
when you need something from me?
Go to hell, Louis!

794
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,894
Okay, you know what?

795
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,479
You're right.

796
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:20,465
I'm not your friend.
Never was.

797
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:22,851
But the one thing
I've never done is lie to you.

798
00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:26,138
Now, you have a chance
to walk out of here today,

799
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:27,823
as if none of this
has ever happened,

800
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:31,910
and all you have to do
is trust me.

801
00:33:31,978 --> 00:33:34,863
You have no idea
who that man is.

802
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:36,498
No idea?

803
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:38,500
How do you think
I got in the room?

804
00:33:38,585 --> 00:33:40,869
Okay, well, you know, Louis,

805
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:43,756
I am glad you got to take
a good look at it,

806
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:45,791
because if I don't
give them Mike,

807
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:49,995
I could be in here
for the rest of my life.

808
00:33:50,046 --> 00:33:53,015
Lawyers don't get paid
to look out the window.

809
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:57,469
I can't concentrate either.

810
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,837
I just wish
there was something we could do.

811
00:33:58,888 --> 00:34:03,175
Rachel, if this thing
moves forward to trial,

812
00:34:03,226 --> 00:34:05,861
I will do everything
in my power to win.

813
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:08,013
But there's two minutes left
in the game,

814
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:10,065
and our star players
are on the field.

815
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:14,036
So right now,
we just have to have faith.

816
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,372
Wwe?

817
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:19,158
We.

818
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:20,959
You're going to work here.

819
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:25,197
We're going to be family.

820
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:28,634
And the way to get to know your
family is by being with them

821
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:31,703
when their loved ones
are in trouble.

822
00:34:34,591 --> 00:34:37,042
How long do we wait?

823
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:42,398
As long as it takes.

824
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:48,737
I want to talk to you
about my defense strategy.

825
00:34:48,822 --> 00:34:50,389
This is
your defense strategy.

826
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,857
If this doesn't work,

827
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:54,226
you're gonna want to talk
to a different lawyer than me.

828
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:55,727
Harvey, I don't care
what Harold gives them on me,

829
00:34:55,779 --> 00:34:58,397
I'm not giving them you.

830
00:34:58,448 --> 00:35:00,332
- I want to tell you a story.
- I don't want to hear a story.

831
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,619
It's about the time I decided
to tell my dad about my mom.

832
00:35:03,703 --> 00:35:04,920
You remember what I told you
about her?

833
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:06,738
- Harvey--
- I was 20,

834
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,090
out of the house,

835
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:09,741
and I told her
I would never tell him

836
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:12,744
as long as she never
brought anyone--

837
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:20,419
I came home to do laundry
one day, and I heard--

838
00:35:23,273 --> 00:35:24,923
I heard,

839
00:35:24,974 --> 00:35:29,728
and then I saw,
and I told him that night.

840
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:37,619
Because sometimes
it's better to tell.

841
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:42,941
She deserved that.

842
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:44,660
So do I.

843
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:46,445
This whole thing
was my idea.

844
00:35:46,496 --> 00:35:48,613
I gave the go-ahead.
It's me Woodall wants.

845
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:50,165
- Well, he's not getting you!
- Yes, he is.

846
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,616
No, I don't care
what happens

847
00:35:51,668 --> 00:35:53,218
in that room,
I'm not giving you up!

848
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:54,670
- Don't be a fool.
- Don't be an asshole!

849
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:57,756
Listen to me, God damn it,
I'm giving you permission--

850
00:35:57,807 --> 00:35:59,758
I don't give a shit
what you're giving me!

851
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:05,347
I hired a fraud.

852
00:36:05,432 --> 00:36:07,632
And then we crossed the line
with Clifford Danner,

853
00:36:07,684 --> 00:36:10,936
then with Lola Jensen,
and then with these witnesses,

854
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:12,104
and to top it all off,

855
00:36:12,155 --> 00:36:14,573
we suborned perjury
with Edward Darby.

856
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,976
If it comes to it, you point
the finger at me, you got that.

857
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:24,149
Let's just hope
it doesn't come to it.

858
00:36:27,337 --> 00:36:31,840
It's over.
Let's get the hell out of here.

859
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:34,710
Hey, Mike.
How's it going?

860
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,271
Mr. Specter!

861
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:49,076
Eric.

862
00:36:49,144 --> 00:36:51,746
Just because you stopped
Gunderson from testifying

863
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:52,864
doesn't mean
I'm dropping this case.

864
00:36:52,948 --> 00:36:54,165
Then don't.

865
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:55,950
And I'll come after you
for malicious prosecution.

866
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:58,786
You have no basis for that.

867
00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:01,322
You arrested my client,
he was here four hours,

868
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:03,991
and you have no log
with an outgoing call to me,

869
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:07,011
all on the basis
of a fabricated terrorism claim.

870
00:37:07,095 --> 00:37:09,964
Now, if that's not malicious,
I don't know what is.

871
00:37:10,015 --> 00:37:11,883
You say what you want.

872
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:15,436
You're a dirty lawyer,
and now you're on my radar.

873
00:37:15,504 --> 00:37:18,139
If I'm a dirty lawyer,

874
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:22,510
then you're looking
in the mirror.

875
00:38:42,441 --> 00:38:43,941
I'm so sorry.

876
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:45,537
I just thought
that

877
00:38:45,562 --> 00:38:47,562
- Rachel.
- I would never--

878
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:52,567
Everything's
gonna be okay.

879
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,241
Hey, honey, I'm home.

880
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:02,326
Did you remember to pick up
the kids like I asked?

881
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:03,794
Yep.

882
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:07,331
The youngest one's turning
into a real pain in the ass.

883
00:39:10,218 --> 00:39:14,672
- It's good to have you back.
- Good to be back.

884
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:18,426
What's on your mind,
Harvey?

885
00:39:18,477 --> 00:39:22,563
You were right.
We are becoming Edward.

886
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:25,966
I know.

887
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:29,103
And we need to get back
to being us.

888
00:39:29,154 --> 00:39:32,857
Did you let her know
about our decision yet?

889
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:36,243
I assumed you'd want
to take care of that yourself.

890
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:47,088
Hey.

891
00:39:47,155 --> 00:39:49,323
Hey.

892
00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:51,959
You want a drink?

893
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:56,764
They do it
on <i>Mad Men,</i>right?

894
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:05,389
Jessica and I are gonna
let you out of your noncompete.

895
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:08,359
What about the buy-in?

896
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:12,530
We'll take care
of the buy-in.

897
00:40:12,614 --> 00:40:13,681
Harvey, I, um--

898
00:40:13,732 --> 00:40:16,317
Mike Ross never went
to law school.

899
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:21,021
I knew it,
and I hired him anyway.

900
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:23,908
Why are you telling me now?

901
00:40:23,992 --> 00:40:27,828
Because you accused Jessica
of being Edward Darby.

902
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:34,301
It wasn't her.
It was me.

903
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:47,148
I still can't stay,
Harvey.

904
00:40:47,215 --> 00:40:49,150
I know.

905
00:40:55,574 --> 00:40:58,659
I just want to stop lying
to the people I love.

906
00:41:04,733 --> 00:41:07,368
I'm sorry.

907
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:23,267
I told her.

908
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:25,770
I know.

909
00:41:25,854 --> 00:41:28,773
- She won't tell anyone.
- I know.

910
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:34,111
She's leaving.

911
00:41:34,196 --> 00:41:36,096
I know.

912
00:41:38,784 --> 00:41:43,404
Harvey, you're a good man.

913
00:41:43,455 --> 00:41:45,456
Am I?

914
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,575
I turned Quelling
into the bar.

915
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:50,911
I took my rage out on him.

916
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:52,797
He didn't deserve it.

917
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:55,716
Which is why I stopped it.

918
00:41:55,784 --> 00:41:58,385
What are you talking about?

919
00:41:58,453 --> 00:42:00,137
Do you seriously think
that Stephanie Liston

920
00:42:00,222 --> 00:42:03,340
is the only person
who owes me a favor?

921
00:42:05,227 --> 00:42:06,460
Well, that doesn't make me
a good man.

922
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:09,013
That makes you
a good man for me.

923
00:42:10,682 --> 00:42:15,519
Harvey, sometimes we need
a little help.

924
00:42:22,811 --> 00:42:24,812
Big day.

925
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:30,501
Horrible day.

926
00:42:30,585 --> 00:42:33,671
It ended well.

927
00:42:33,755 --> 00:42:34,922
Thank you.

928
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:37,625
You and Louis
really came through.

929
00:42:37,676 --> 00:42:41,095
So did you.

930
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:44,715
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

931
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,600
- No, you don't.
- You don't want to go to jail.

932
00:42:46,668 --> 00:42:48,686
Harvey...

933
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:55,059
I sat in that room today
and listened to you tell me

934
00:42:55,143 --> 00:42:57,111
that ever since the day
we met,

935
00:42:57,178 --> 00:42:58,279
you've had to cross one line

936
00:42:58,346 --> 00:43:00,281
after another, and--
Mike-

937
00:43:00,348 --> 00:43:03,784
No, just...
Let me finish.

938
00:43:05,704 --> 00:43:08,038
First there was
Clifford Danner,

939
00:43:08,123 --> 00:43:10,040
then the witnesses,

940
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,743
then suborning perjury,
not to mention the 17 things

941
00:43:12,828 --> 00:43:17,798
we did to stop the merger
in the first place.

942
00:43:17,866 --> 00:43:19,466
All of it,
since you hired me.

943
00:43:19,534 --> 00:43:22,169
Look, that's not
what I said.

944
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,537
Yes, it is.

945
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:25,706
I wasn't blaming you
for those things.

946
00:43:25,757 --> 00:43:27,708
It doesn't matter.

947
00:43:30,228 --> 00:43:33,430
I'm tired of putting the people
I care about in jeopardy.

948
00:43:38,236 --> 00:43:42,489
I called Jonathan Sidwell
this afternoon.

949
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:46,827
I took the job.

950
00:43:46,895 --> 00:43:48,896
We just got out.

951
00:43:48,947 --> 00:43:52,416
Harvey...

952
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,419
You gave me permission
to point the finger at you.

953
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:02,042
Give me permission to go.

954
00:44:20,562 --> 00:44:23,314
You're a good man, Harvey.

955
00:44:23,398 --> 00:44:25,316
Thanks.

956
00:44:32,657 --> 00:44:34,959
Hey, when's your last day?

957
00:44:35,043 --> 00:44:36,610
I don't know.
Why?

958
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:38,162
Well, I want to take you out
to dinner, you know?

959
00:44:38,246 --> 00:44:39,713
I'm not gonna see you anymore.

960
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:43,751
I don't think you realize,
but I'm not exactly leaving.

961
00:44:46,254 --> 00:44:48,639
Sidwell.
You're a client.

962
00:44:48,723 --> 00:44:50,791
Which means technically,
you work for me now.

963
00:44:50,842 --> 00:44:52,810
No, I don't.

964
00:44:52,894 --> 00:44:54,395
"No, I don't, boss."

965
00:44:54,462 --> 00:44:55,763
- Don't even try it.
- Or "sir."

966
00:44:55,814 --> 00:44:57,231
Whichever feels
least comfortable.

967
00:44:57,298 --> 00:44:59,350
You know,
since I'm working alone now,

968
00:44:59,434 --> 00:45:01,318
I guess
that makes me Superman.

969
00:45:01,403 --> 00:45:04,405
Or Aquaman, seeing
as you're in over your head.
