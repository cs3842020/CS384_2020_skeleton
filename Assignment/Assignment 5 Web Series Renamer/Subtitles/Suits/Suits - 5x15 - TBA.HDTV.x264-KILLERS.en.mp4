to railroad him

Ms. Gibbs, he may be a fraud
in your court,

You plead guilty,

and I won't go after
any of your friends.

We both know you did this.

So if you don't want to pay,

then you take me up

- Because I do.

And I also know that
the last time you had

you went to her and not me.

No, Harvey,
