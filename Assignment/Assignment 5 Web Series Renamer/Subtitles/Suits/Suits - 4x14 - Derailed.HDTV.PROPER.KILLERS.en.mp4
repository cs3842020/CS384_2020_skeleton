1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,870
So I sign this and the bribery
allegations are gone?

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:05,537
And no one ever knows
a thing.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,241
You never let me tell you
what the money was for.

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,442
You didn't listen to me
when I told you I don't care.

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,278
Well, do you care
that after Mike grilled me,

6
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,047
I was so impressed with him that
I wonder why I'd forgotten him?

7
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:19,685
But I couldn't find any record
of him ever being in my class.

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,787
Just like they're not gonna
find any record of you

9
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,655
accepting a bribe
from a student.

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,425
Jessica, your secret
is safe with me.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,495
I told him you found out

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,264
that I covered up
Daniel Hardman's embezzlement.

13
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,500
And now you want me to protect
another one of your secrets.

14
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,735
It's the same secret, Louis,

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,704
and you have just as much
invested in it as I do.

16
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,939
You want me to kiss the ring,
Louis, after what you did?

17
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:42,340
You're damn right I do,

18
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,276
because I don't care
how it got up there.

19
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,780
My name is on that wall
whether you like it or not.

20
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,967
- Hey.
- Hey.

21
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,169
What do you think
of this tie?

22
00:01:12,203 --> 00:01:13,904
I think...

23
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:17,140
I want to
tie you up with it.

24
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:23,046
Really?
And what brought that on?

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,515
Okay, well,

26
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,718
then let's make

27
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:31,855
that happen.

28
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:33,323
Wait.

29
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:34,524
Is this to do things
to me

30
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:36,125
or just to get control
of the remote?

31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,761
Why can't it be both?

32
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:40,463
Rachel, if you think I'm gonna
let you watch <i>Game of Thrones</i>

33
00:01:40,497 --> 00:01:42,030
while sexually dominating me,

34
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:45,067
then you are absolutely right.

35
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:50,706
Seriously, what's got you
feeling so good?

36
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,140
Oh, it just feels like
such a weight off

37
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:53,408
now that Louis doesn't--

38
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:55,077
- Despise me?
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:57,179
Ah, you know what else
would feel like a weight off?

40
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,684
- Oh--
- No. No, no, no.

41
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:03,519
Nobody ever calls
the landline except my parents.

42
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:05,187
- What if something's wrong?
- It's fine.

43
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,221
Mike.

44
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:08,590
Okay, okay, okay.

45
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:09,992
Hello.

46
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:11,994
Yeah, this is him.

47
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,199
Yeah, of course
I can come meet you.

48
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:20,469
Can I ask what this is--
hello?

49
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:21,536
Who was it?

50
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,005
Professor Gerard.

51
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,572
He wants me to go meet him.

52
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:25,807
Did he say
what it was about?

53
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,442
No, he hung up.

54
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:29,044
When does he want you
to meet him?

55
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:30,212
Right now.

56
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:36,884
- Professor Gerard.
- Thanks for coming.

57
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,819
I wouldn't have bothered you
if it wasn't important.

58
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:40,854
It's not a problem.
What can I help you with?

59
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:42,623
It's not me.

60
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:45,993
A former employee at
Liberty Rail reached out to me.

61
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:47,594
He claims he was fired
because he knows

62
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:49,430
the real reason
for the crash.

63
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:52,333
And what was
the real reason?

64
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:53,700
He wouldn't tell me.

65
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:54,902
Well, what did he
tell you?

66
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:57,138
Enough for me to know
it would be unethical

67
00:02:57,172 --> 00:03:00,541
if somebody didn't
look into this.

68
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:03,744
But you can't, so you want me
to get Harvey to.

69
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:06,013
Well, you convinced him
to look into my case

70
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:07,248
when he didn't want to,
didn't you?

71
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:09,616
This is different.
We don't take cases like this.

72
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:12,653
Maybe,

73
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:15,622
but I believe a man
who can convince Harvey

74
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:17,490
to hire someone
who never went to law school

75
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:20,360
could convince him
to make an exception for this.

76
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,032
What?

77
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,900
He didn't tell you I know.

78
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:30,671
No, he didn't.

79
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:33,006
Well, I do.

80
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:38,812
But what I'm asking you to do
and me knowing

81
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:40,980
have nothing
to do with each other.

82
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,184
I appreciate that.

83
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:48,287
Does that mean that you're
gonna tell him to take the case?

84
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:49,889
I have a better idea.

85
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:56,963
Got a second?

86
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:59,231
Of course.
What do you need?

87
00:03:59,265 --> 00:04:02,068
I'd like you to sign off
on my vacation request.

88
00:04:04,404 --> 00:04:06,138
Paris.

89
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:07,739
I've never heard you
talk about Paris.

90
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:11,176
No, but I have heard you
talk about it,

91
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,178
which is why I'm taking you.

92
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,748
Are you asking me
to go to Paris with you?

93
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:18,016
I believe I just did.

94
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,090
Jeff, do you have any idea

95
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,519
how much is on my plate
right now?

96
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:21,686
Actually, I do, all of which

97
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:24,022
Harvey has agreed to cover.

98
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,924
You went to Harvey with this.

99
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,359
Well, I would have
come to you first,

100
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:30,262
but then it really
wouldn't be a surprise.

101
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:34,232
I'll think about it.

102
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:36,334
Take all the time you need.

103
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:37,701
But in the meantime,

104
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,671
I'll be thinking about
who else around here I can take.

105
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:42,240
Really?

106
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:44,408
Well, you're awfully
sure of yourself.

107
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:47,011
You think I haven't seen
the way Norma looks at me?

108
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:48,912
Calls me
the Black Stallion.

109
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,054
Norma.

110
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,291
Taking a case.

111
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:02,693
What kind of case?

112
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:03,994
What does it matter?

113
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:05,896
Because you wouldn't be
announcing it like that

114
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,364
if there wasn't something wrong.

115
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:10,367
It's a case that came
from Professor Gerard.

116
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:11,468
What?

117
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:12,736
A man who used to work
at Liberty Rail

118
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,771
says the real cause
of the crash was covered up.

119
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:16,072
Then refer him to a firm

120
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:17,840
that takes whistle-blower cases,
because we don't.

121
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:18,941
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

122
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:20,476
Then don't,
but there's a reason

123
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,812
lawyers who take whistle-blower
cases don't work here,

124
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:24,313
and it's because corporations

125
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:26,082
don't appreciate
shakedown artists.

126
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,476
And what if
this isn't a shakedown?

127
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:28,617
And how do you know
it isn't?

128
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:30,252
What I know is that
innocent people died--

129
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,789
mothers and fathers
and sons and daughters--

130
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:35,158
and if somebody's covering up
why that happened

131
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:36,726
and I can stop it,
then I'm going to.

132
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,127
And I said you're not.

133
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:40,029
Well, but you also said
that Professor Gerard

134
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:41,864
didn't know my secret.

135
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:45,500
Harvey, I know,
I know he'll never tell anyone,

136
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:47,703
but someday, someone's
gonna find out who will,

137
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:48,737
and I'll be done.

138
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:49,771
Mike, he's not--

139
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:51,506
Harvey, I got
into this whole thing

140
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,810
so that I could try
to help people,

141
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,544
and I don't know
how much time I have left,

142
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:00,749
so please,

143
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:03,785
let me try
and help these people.

144
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:09,124
Then you better make damn sure

145
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:12,159
this whistle-blower
isn't full of sh--.

160
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:57,512
I know.

161
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,848
Never thought I'd have
someone ask my permission

162
00:06:59,883 --> 00:07:01,149
to take you to Paris.

163
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:03,118
You know damn well
that's not what Jeff did.

164
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:07,122
Jessica, what exactly
do you want to talk about?

165
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:09,424
I want to know
why you cleared my schedule.

166
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,025
Because Jeff asked me to,

167
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,894
and I can't remember the last
time you took a vacation.

168
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:14,629
When's the last time
you took a vacation?

169
00:07:14,663 --> 00:07:16,598
I'm not the one
in a serious relationship.

170
00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:18,032
Oh, so you're playing matchmaker
for me now?

171
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:19,267
Oh, I'm not playing anything,

172
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:20,835
and you were the one
who said you had to choose

173
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:23,871
between hiring him
and continuing to see him.

174
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:25,207
And then I changed my mind.

175
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:27,109
And I don't want you
to make the same mistake I did.

176
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:30,645
What are you talking about?

177
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,247
I should have taken
some time with Scottie.

178
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:34,015
Jeff and I are not
you and Scottie.

179
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,484
Jessica, take a vacation.

180
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:36,918
Don't take a vacation.

181
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:38,320
The man came in here,

182
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:40,654
asking me for help because
he wants to go away with you,

183
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:43,757
and I said yes because I'm not
gonna be the reason he can't.

184
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:57,471
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

185
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:04,444
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

186
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:11,651
- Louis, do you have a minute?
- No, I don't.

187
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:14,521
Okay.
What are you doing?

188
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:16,789
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

189
00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:19,159
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

190
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:20,660
You hear--

191
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:22,228
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

192
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:26,331
Hello?
Pearson Specter--

193
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,867
You hear that?

194
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,601
Where's the Litt?

195
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:31,436
Every call is like a slap
in the face.

196
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:33,673
Louis, it's standard practice
for a law firm

197
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:34,940
to shorten their name
on the phone.

198
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:36,909
So blatant disrespect
is standard practice now?

199
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:38,443
It's not disrespect.
It's just--

200
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:40,512
You're telling me
that your father doesn't

201
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:41,580
have them answer the phone,

202
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:43,315
"Rand, Kaldore, Zane"?

203
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:44,684
Actually, no, he doesn't,

204
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:48,187
and I think you'd agree
that people respect my father.

205
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:49,453
Unless you want to go back
to telling me

206
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,689
that he's a shady lawyer.

207
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:52,603
Come on, Rachel,
that was when I was mad at you.

208
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:56,761
Which is actually why I wanted
to come and talk to you.

209
00:08:57,997 --> 00:09:00,965
I want to thank you
for forgiving Mike.

210
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,502
It--it means a lot to me.

211
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:06,204
Now, can you stop
obsessing over the phone

212
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:08,673
long enough to hear that?

213
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,908
I'm sorry, Rachel,

214
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,309
but I can't,

215
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,211
and now I have to go rip
that receptionist a new ass--

216
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:16,247
Louis, if one of your first acts
as name partner

217
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:19,049
is to rip the receptionist
to shreds,

218
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:21,319
you'll regret that
for the rest of your life.

219
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,187
Just let it go.

220
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:24,488
Let it go.

221
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,758
Things will run
their course.

222
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,760
You know what, Rachel?
You're right.

223
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:33,797
And by the way, I'm glad
that we're friends again.

224
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:46,008
Pearson Specter--

225
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:52,515
Harvey, what are you doing
at 3:30 this afternoon?

226
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,883
Why?

227
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,152
I have some news, and I don't
want you to overreact.

228
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,186
What is it?

229
00:09:57,187 --> 00:10:00,590
Jeffrey Bender
wants to meet with you.

230
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,158
He heard we're taking
a whistle-blower case,

231
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:05,160
and he wants us to drop it.

232
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:08,430
Relax, I'll take care
of Jeffrey Bender.

233
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:09,565
Wait a second,
you're not gonna try

234
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,367
to cut Mike's legs
out from under him

235
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:12,735
- before he even gets started?
- What's the point?

236
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:15,237
He'd just bother me
until I agreed not to anyway.

237
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,875
I can't believe it.

238
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:22,311
You have no idea what to say.

239
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:24,546
What's the date today?
I want to write this down.

240
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,348
You know what?

241
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:27,949
It's the seventh
of kiss my ass,

242
00:10:27,984 --> 00:10:31,086
and tomorrow is the eighth of
set your own goddamn meetings.

243
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,420
Is that the Mayan calendar?

244
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:34,489
Nope,
that's the Donna calendar.

245
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:37,292
I got you.
For the record, I got you.

246
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,664
All right, take me
through it one more time.

247
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:44,766
It's simple.

248
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:48,069
There are axles on all the cars
in all the trains,

249
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:51,072
and those axles have sensors to
make sure they don't overheat.

250
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:52,540
So you're saying
that the train crashed

251
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:53,875
because the heat sensors
failed.

252
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,311
I'm saying
that all the heat sensors

253
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:58,846
on the entire fleet were faulty,

254
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,247
and they knew about it.

255
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:01,849
Then why didn't you
come forward with this before?

256
00:11:01,883 --> 00:11:04,218
You mean before they fired me
for coming forward with it?

257
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:05,753
Which brings me
to my next question.

258
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:08,255
You've had four different jobs
in the last six years.

259
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,290
What are you getting at?

260
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,459
I want to know why.

261
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:12,660
I move around.

262
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:14,028
It's not uncommon
in my business.

263
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,531
Move around or keep failing?

264
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:18,833
I got fired
for blowing the whistle,

265
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:20,301
not for messing up on the job.

266
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:22,296
That's not what your last
performance review says.

267
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:24,103
I don't give a shit
what it says.

268
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:26,206
They used that as an excuse
to fire me,

269
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,775
and my reviews
before I came forward

270
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,477
passed with flying colors.

271
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:31,578
I'm a solid worker.

272
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:32,946
How the hell do you think
I got this?

273
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,748
I know your reviews
are stellar.

274
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:36,750
What I need to know is
if there's anything out there

275
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:38,918
that we don't have, because
they are gonna come at us

276
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:41,287
any way they can,
and when they do,

277
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:42,823
it's not gonna
be about heat sensors.

278
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,358
It's gonna be about you.

279
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:47,327
Yeah, I don't care if
I'm the worst guy in the world.

280
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:49,796
I know I'm not the only guy
in that company

281
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:51,965
that knows
those sensors are faulty.

282
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:55,969
What are you talking about?

283
00:11:56,003 --> 00:11:57,737
What do you mean,
there's a report?

284
00:11:57,771 --> 00:12:00,907
Done after the crash
that showed a defective part

285
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:03,343
was the real cause,
not engineer error.

286
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:04,510
Says the whistle-blower.

287
00:12:04,544 --> 00:12:07,413
Says these.

288
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:09,015
That's a memo
ordering the report

289
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:11,817
and another email
acknowledging its existence.

290
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:13,152
We got 'em.

291
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:14,820
- We do.
- Set a meeting.

292
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:16,890
Let them do the talking,
then drop the hammer,

293
00:12:16,924 --> 00:12:18,224
and stick a settlement
down their throat

294
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:19,225
before they know
what hit them.

295
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,826
I appreciate the advice,
Harvey,

296
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,827
but this time I'm going in
with the hammer in my hand,

297
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:24,529
and I am coming out swinging.

298
00:12:24,563 --> 00:12:26,398
Okay, big talker,
how much you asking for?

299
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:28,166
40 million.

300
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:29,501
Are you kidding me?

301
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:31,937
They'll pay ten times that
without even trying.

302
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:33,305
Not when I tell them
they're gonna have to admit

303
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:34,606
what they did.

304
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,408
- Are you nuts?
- No, I am not.

305
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:37,842
We are not sealing
this settlement,

306
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:40,279
and before you say another word,
this is my case.

307
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:41,513
I don't care
whose case it is.

308
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:43,282
They're never going to admit
what they did.

309
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:44,956
Pick a higher number
and let them seal it.

310
00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:47,219
Harvey, you told me to prove
this wasn't a shakedown.

311
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:49,554
Now you want me to take money
to cover things up?

312
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:51,322
You know what that is?
A shakedown!

313
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:54,025
A shakedown is when
your case has no merit.

314
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,326
This is the way things work.

315
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,827
Not to mention,
if we quietly settle,

316
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,996
we don't have to worry
about scaring away our clients.

317
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:00,697
That's why
it's the way things work.

318
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:02,800
Harvey, people died
in this crash!

319
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,436
And they're not coming back, no
matter what Liberty Rail admits.

320
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,405
You are such a cold,
heartless son of a bitch.

321
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:09,206
And this isn't
about your parents,

322
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:11,175
so back them
into whatever corner you want,

323
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,110
but when they refuse
to admit what they did,

324
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:15,879
you are not going to trial.

325
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:21,585
Stay out of my case.

326
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:35,286
Something smells delicious.

327
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,556
I'm making us dinner, but it
won't be ready for a while.

328
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:41,259
Good,
that means we have time

329
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:43,795
to go over
my proposed itinerary.

330
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:46,030
I don't recall saying yes.

331
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:48,266
I thought that we would start

332
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,002
with a private tour
of the Rodin.

333
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:52,436
Oh, the Rodin.

334
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,072
God, I must have visited that
sculpture garden a dozen times.

335
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:57,874
Then I'm so glad that I arranged
for us to have a picnic

336
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:59,309
while we're there,

337
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:00,376
and during that picnic,

338
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:03,814
we can reminisce
about the week before,

339
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:06,683
where we danced the night away
in the Latin Quarter.

340
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:08,118
We did?

341
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:10,921
Mm, or we'll talk
about how we'll end the trip

342
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:13,423
in the Loire Valley,

343
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:17,593
where we will sip wine
along the Seine.

344
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:24,166
Jeff, this trip is perfect.
How did you know?

345
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:27,437
I know you've always
loved Paris, so I started there.

346
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:30,606
And then
I called your sister.

347
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,007
You did that for me?

348
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,909
I did.

349
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:37,279
So what do you say?

350
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:41,417
I say,

351
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:45,321
if you knew
what I was cooking,

352
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:47,189
you'd already know
my answer.

353
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:55,397
- Looks French.
- Mm-hmm.

354
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:57,233
So you let me go through
all that even though

355
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,301
you knew you were gonna
say yes the entire time?

356
00:14:59,336 --> 00:15:00,769
Mm-hmm.

357
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:03,138
Aren't you glad I did?

358
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:05,307
Yes, Jessica.

359
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,443
Yes, I am.

360
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:22,423
Donna, what are you
doing here?

361
00:15:22,457 --> 00:15:25,193
I'm here
because I can't take it anymore.

362
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,527
What?

363
00:15:26,561 --> 00:15:29,697
This place has no life,
and I can't take it anymore.

364
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:31,266
And that's gonna add life?

365
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,620
If I gave you
something too needy,

366
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:34,702
it would intimidate you,
and you would let it die.

367
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:37,538
You expect me to believe
that's why you're really here?

368
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:38,939
Of course not.

369
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:40,073
I'm here to stop you
from doing

370
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,741
what you're gonna do
in an hour:

371
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:43,010
crash Mike's meeting.

372
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:45,145
Donna, I can't have him
risking our other business.

373
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,846
It was one client,
and you covered it.

374
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:48,215
And if he drags this
to trial,

375
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:49,316
it will be every client.

376
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,817
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

377
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:52,852
Then trust him
to accept that on his own.

378
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:54,154
Donna--

379
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:56,256
Harvey, when are you gonna
let him be his own man?

380
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,425
His own man?
He's out of control.

381
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,493
He's identifying these people
with his parents.

382
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:01,895
And you're out of control
because you can't

383
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,230
separate yourself from him.

384
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:04,664
Okay, you need
to stay out of it.

385
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,866
And I will, but you said
you made a mistake

386
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:09,869
not trusting Mike
with Gillis Industries.

387
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:12,906
I'm telling you,
don't make that mistake again.

388
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,421
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

389
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:35,794
Uh--

390
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,177
Rand, Kaldore, Zane.

391
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,211
Son of a bitch!

392
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,949
Hello, liar.

393
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,051
- Excuse me?
- Rand, Kaldore, Zane.

394
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,486
You know what that is?

395
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,122
That's how they answer the phone
at Rand, Kaldore, Zane.

396
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,890
- Louis, I'm sorry.
- Oh, save your sorrys.

397
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,225
Do you know the receptionist
at the front desk?

398
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,893
Yes, her name is Elise.

399
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,029
Good, you can use her name
when you fire her.

400
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,064
I don't have the authority
to fire people,

401
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,732
but I did just talk to her.

402
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:15,833
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

403
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,834
To set her straight.
That's good.

404
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,902
No, not good.

405
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,270
She came to see me.

406
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,106
She said that
you've been harassing her.

407
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,574
What happened?

408
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,711
She said that you called and
hung up on her over 50 times.

409
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:27,845
What?
How did she even know it was me?

410
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,346
Because you called
from your office.

411
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,181
Well, it wasn't harassment
because it wasn't sexual.

412
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,751
Well, she also said that
you were leering at her

413
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:34,819
when you stepped
off the elevator.

414
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,020
I wasn't leering!

415
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:37,454
I was mad about
how she answered the phone.

416
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,656
Louis, it doesn't matter
why you did it.

417
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,190
She felt violated.

418
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,393
Well, you know what,
you tell her it's not like that,

419
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:45,897
and then you violate her ass
out the door.

420
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:49,800
Louis, is this really the kind
of name partner you want to be?

421
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,435
No, I want to be
the kind of name partner

422
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:53,369
that has his name
said on the goddamn phone.

423
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:55,204
Okay, well,
in order to fire her

424
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,673
without getting sued
for harassment,

425
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:58,174
you'd have to fire
the entire support staff,

426
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:02,445
and you and I both know that
that's never going to happen.

427
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:04,814
We are not firing
all of our support staff.

428
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:06,683
Well, it's easy for you to say,
being that your name is first.

429
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:07,717
What are you talking--

430
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:09,519
Jessica, I am talking
about respect.

431
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:13,222
R-e-s-p-e-c-t,
find out what it means to me.

432
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:14,524
But I guess
I'll just find my own way

433
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,793
to be treated
how I deserve.

434
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:18,761
I know I'm gonna regret
asking this.

435
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:22,397
Louis, tell me specifically
what it is you're talking about.

436
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:27,703
They are answering the phones,
"Pearson Specter,"

437
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:29,438
not "Pearson Specter Litt."

438
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:30,673
Louis--

439
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:32,474
You don't believe me?
Check it yourself.

440
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:33,842
I'm not harassing
our support staff.

441
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:35,177
It's not harassment,
God damn it!

442
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:36,545
Louis!

443
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,914
Jessica, it's like they've
been specifically instructed

444
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:40,315
to leave my name off.

445
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:41,483
Now you're just
being paranoid.

446
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:43,085
I am not paranoid.
They're in lockstep.

447
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,187
I'm telling you,
someone paid them off.

448
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:47,322
Louis, that's insane,

449
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:49,458
but if you want them
to say your name,

450
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:51,460
I will get them
to say your name.

451
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,035
Jessica,
what can I do for you?

452
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,472
You can explain to me
why you paid our reception staff

453
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:05,974
not to say Louis' name
when they answer the phone.

454
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:08,009
- Who says I did that?
- They do.

455
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:09,777
God damn it.

456
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:11,345
I paid them good money
to keep Louis

457
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:12,580
from finding out
for at least a month.

458
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:13,848
He hasn't found out.

459
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:15,850
It wasn't him who got them
to crack, it was me.

460
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:17,719
Even still,
I'm asking for a refund.

461
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:20,354
Jeff, I'm serious
about this.

462
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:24,892
I know you're pissed about
how he got his name on the door,

463
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:27,394
but I need you
to bury the hatchet.

464
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:29,363
- Well, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

465
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:31,465
Because every single time
I see his rat face,

466
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,866
I think about him
blackmailing you,

467
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,101
and it makes me want
to walk over to him

468
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:35,468
and rip his arms
off his body,

469
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:38,872
and that little phone prank
was just my way

470
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:42,042
of keeping myself
from doing something like that.

471
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:43,510
I understand,

472
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:45,712
and I do appreciate it,

473
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:48,181
but I'm not asking you
to do it for him.

474
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:50,216
I'm asking you to do it
for me.

475
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:00,826
Mr. Ross.

476
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:02,395
All I can say about your filing
is that I think

477
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:04,597
you might have a career
writing fiction.

478
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:06,666
And if you don't hand over
that report we're requesting,

479
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,368
you're gonna
have a career behind bars.

480
00:20:08,402 --> 00:20:09,802
You're not here
for that report.

481
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:12,138
You're here to strong arm
my client into a big, fat check.

482
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:13,540
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

483
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:16,409
but a big, fat check
isn't gonna get you out of this.

484
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:17,910
- Is that a fact?
- Sure as hell is,

485
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:19,279
because we both know
that report

486
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:21,681
says you're responsible
for this accident,

487
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:23,816
and we're not settling anything
without you admitting it.

488
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,851
And we're not admitting
something we didn't do.

489
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:29,588
What the hell is this?

490
00:20:29,622 --> 00:20:30,889
Well, you wanted the report.

491
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:32,524
Here it is.

492
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,393
Your client wasn't lying
about its existence.

493
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:36,328
He was just lying
about everything else.

494
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:38,330
We ran repeated tests
on our heat sensors,

495
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:40,098
and they passed every one.

496
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:43,134
This is bullshit.

497
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:44,236
The only thing that's bullshit

498
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,804
is Joe Henderson.

499
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,406
He doesn't care
about the accident.

500
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,107
All he's trying to do
is shake us down,

501
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:51,810
exactly like he did
at his last four jobs.

502
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:56,581
What the hell is that?

503
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:59,117
His last four lawsuits.

504
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:00,618
Did you think we wouldn't
find out about them

505
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:02,220
just because the records
were sealed?

506
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:04,322
Mr. Ross,
your client's been playing

507
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:06,424
the whistle-blower lottery
for years.

508
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,892
He's never won before.

509
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:09,794
He's not going to win today.

510
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:21,840
You son of a bitch,
you tried to blow the whistle

511
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:25,876
at every job you've ever had,
and now they know it!

512
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,345
Keep your voice down.

513
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:30,014
You--
no, I'll keep my voice down

514
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,381
when you stop bullshit-ing me.

515
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,717
Those claims were
supposed to be sealed.

516
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,452
I don't care what they were
supposed to be.

517
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:38,388
They found them, and you were
supposed to tell me about them.

518
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,323
And what would you
have done if I did?

519
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:41,659
I would've said
what they said,

520
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:43,533
that you don't give a shit
about what they did!

521
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:44,928
You're just looking
to get rich.

522
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:46,729
You think I would've
risked my job

523
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,199
and everything that I have
for nothing?

524
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,233
Excuse me?

525
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,235
I said, I don't see you

526
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,936
working out of the goodness
of your heart

527
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:56,005
in your $1,000 suit.

528
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,209
You have no idea
who I am or why I do things.

529
00:21:59,243 --> 00:22:02,279
And I told you, you don't have
to be concerned about my history

530
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:05,282
because what
I'm telling you is true.

531
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:07,083
Not according to this.

532
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,486
That's the report that you said
gave us all the leverage

533
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,488
and they say
proves them innocent.

534
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:13,256
That report is bullshit,

535
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,925
because I'm telling you,
those sensors didn't work,

536
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,526
and that was the cause
of that accident.

537
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:18,828
Well, I might have
a leg to stand on

538
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:20,963
if you had
any credibility at all.

539
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:22,832
How the hell am I supposed
to get a jury to believe you

540
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:24,867
when I'm not even sure I do?

541
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:35,044
What are you doing here?

542
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,813
I'm here to tell you
to call the front desk.

543
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:38,781
Oh, let me guess.

544
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,615
Jessica told you
they won't say my name

545
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:41,983
and you thought
it was hilarious.

546
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:43,185
You're right, I did.

547
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:44,252
Why don't you get the hell
out of my office

548
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:46,354
and go laugh somewhere else?

549
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:47,856
Oh, you want to hit me now?

550
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,858
Yeah, well, why don't you go
ask Mike Ross about my headlock?

551
00:22:49,892 --> 00:22:52,060
'Cause it's a goddamn vice.

552
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:58,366
Pearson Specter Litt,

553
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,401
how may I direct your call?

554
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:06,474
It was you.

555
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:07,843
Yes, it was me,

556
00:23:07,877 --> 00:23:10,445
but I fixed it,
so...

557
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:12,380
you can stop worrying
if everybody at the firm

558
00:23:12,414 --> 00:23:15,483
respects you,
because they do.

559
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:21,489
Everyone except you.

560
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:29,764
No, Louis, including me.

561
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:32,333
Listen, I may not like how
you got your name on the wall,

562
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:34,902
but that doesn't mean
it shouldn't be up there.

563
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:40,140
Congratulations, Louis.

564
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:42,976
Thanks, Jeff.

565
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,812
Hey, maybe we can even
get drinks this week.

566
00:23:47,114 --> 00:23:50,384
- Name partner buys.
- Deal.

567
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:52,018
Done.

568
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,378
You can leave the coffee,
but I'm not getting up.

569
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:01,728
Mike, you've been working
for seven hours straight.

570
00:24:01,763 --> 00:24:03,229
You need a break.

571
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:04,864
I've been working for seven
hours because if I tell Harvey

572
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:06,333
what's going on
before I have a fix,

573
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:07,601
he is gonna pull the plug.

574
00:24:07,635 --> 00:24:09,335
Well, then maybe the plug
needs to be pulled.

575
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:11,070
Rachel, just because
Joe Henderson is

576
00:24:11,105 --> 00:24:12,172
a bullshit plaintiff
doesn't mean

577
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:13,372
they didn't cover things up.

578
00:24:13,407 --> 00:24:16,142
It doesn't mean
that they did.

579
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:17,677
Okay, fine.

580
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:18,812
Why would he ask
for that report

581
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:21,514
if he knew
it would hurt our case?

582
00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:22,882
- I don't know.
- I don't know either,

583
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:24,517
which is why I need more time.

584
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:26,619
Well, then you need to convince
Harvey to let you keep going,

585
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:28,221
because if you don't
and he finds out--

586
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:29,689
He is not gonna find out.

587
00:24:29,723 --> 00:24:32,625
Mike, he's not gonna
find out from me,

588
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:34,894
but if I've learned one thing
in the last six months

589
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:39,031
of working here, it's that if
he finds out from somebody else,

590
00:24:39,065 --> 00:24:41,533
you're gonna regret it.

591
00:24:47,273 --> 00:24:48,907
You come here to tell me
you're taking that vacation?

592
00:24:48,942 --> 00:24:50,775
I came by to ask
when Mike Ross started taking

593
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,810
whistle-blower cases.

594
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:52,811
Jessica--

595
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:54,112
I want you
to put the brakes on him

596
00:24:54,147 --> 00:24:55,314
before this gets
out of control.

597
00:24:55,348 --> 00:24:57,282
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

598
00:24:57,317 --> 00:24:58,984
- Harvey.
- Jessica, it's one case.

599
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:01,519
He asked me to trust him,
and I'm gonna do it,

600
00:25:01,554 --> 00:25:03,755
and if you're ever gonna
be able to enjoy a vacation,

601
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:06,924
you're gonna have to trust me.

602
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:10,261
All right.
Good night.

603
00:25:10,295 --> 00:25:12,629
Bon voyage.

604
00:25:12,664 --> 00:25:14,732
You do know
that doesn't mean "good night."

605
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:15,967
Of course I do.

606
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:17,969
Do you know how to say
"good night" in French?

607
00:25:18,003 --> 00:25:20,571
What, do you think
I'm some kind of Neanderthal?

608
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:23,941
You don't know one word
of French, do you?

609
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:25,109
<i>Ménage à trois.</i>

610
00:25:25,143 --> 00:25:26,978
You're an idiot.

611
00:25:28,313 --> 00:25:30,514
<i>Ménage à quatre.</i>

612
00:25:30,548 --> 00:25:32,350
<i>Ménage à cinq.</i>

613
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:36,019
Can I come in?

614
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:43,226
What's going on?

615
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:44,261
We have a problem.

616
00:25:44,262 --> 00:25:46,296
I'm listening.

617
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,232
Liberty Rail's report
directly contradicts our claim.

618
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:50,667
That's a big damn problem.

619
00:25:50,702 --> 00:25:52,235
I believe my client, Harvey.

620
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,437
Based on what, your gut?

621
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:55,238
No, I found the guy
who wrote the report.

622
00:25:55,273 --> 00:25:57,641
He's on indefinite leave
in Australia,

623
00:25:57,675 --> 00:25:59,242
where we can't subpoena him.

624
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:01,144
So it's our word
against theirs.

625
00:26:01,178 --> 00:26:02,845
Which is why I'm here.

626
00:26:04,848 --> 00:26:08,451
Joe Henderson made four other
claims in the last six years.

627
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:09,725
- You're shit-ing me.
- Harvey--

628
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:11,922
That's it.
I'm pulling the plug.

629
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:13,223
I knew it.

630
00:26:13,257 --> 00:26:14,958
I knew you would bail on me
the second this thing

631
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:16,059
hit the smallest bump.

632
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:17,260
Bail on you?

633
00:26:17,295 --> 00:26:19,262
I backed you because you told me
you had a case.

634
00:26:19,297 --> 00:26:21,965
I do have a case.
I told you they got to this guy.

635
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,033
And you got no proof of that.

636
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,100
And if this were your case,

637
00:26:24,135 --> 00:26:26,069
you would be begging me
for help to get it.

638
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:27,603
It's not my case.
It's yours.

639
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:29,171
And now you're asking a jury

640
00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:31,574
to believe these guys
fabricated a report

641
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:33,743
based on the word
of a career whistle-blower.

642
00:26:33,777 --> 00:26:35,511
No, I'm asking you
to believe it.

643
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:37,012
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

644
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:38,948
This guy is
a goddamn shakedown artist,

645
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:39,982
and I'm pulling the plug.

646
00:26:39,983 --> 00:26:41,216
I don't care what he is.

647
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:44,320
I'm not
a goddamn shakedown artist!

648
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,721
Mike--

649
00:26:45,756 --> 00:26:50,726
Harvey, you told me that
those people weren't my parents,

650
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:52,895
but they are
somebody's parents.

651
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,399
Please.

652
00:26:58,936 --> 00:27:00,937
You got 24 hours.

653
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:20,850
You know it's against the law
to litter, don't you?

654
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:22,284
What do you want, Donna?

655
00:27:22,318 --> 00:27:23,518
I know you went to see Harvey.

656
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,953
You know that
he wants me to fail.

657
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:26,288
That's not true.

658
00:27:26,322 --> 00:27:28,290
I don't have anything,
and he only gave me a day.

659
00:27:28,324 --> 00:27:29,392
And if he wanted you to fail,

660
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:32,227
he wouldn't have given you
another second.

661
00:27:32,262 --> 00:27:34,697
You know he thinks
this is about my parents, right?

662
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:39,834
Is it?

663
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:46,408
Maybe it is,

664
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:48,743
but what these people did
is a million times worse

665
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:51,012
because they knew
it could happen.

666
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,514
Wait a second--
they knew this could happen,

667
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:53,848
and they didn't fix it before?

668
00:27:53,883 --> 00:27:55,917
Yeah, Donna, and then they--
they rolled the dice.

669
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:57,018
Well, what about now?

670
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:58,152
Are those trains
still messed up?

671
00:27:58,186 --> 00:27:59,587
Because that would
make them monsters.

672
00:27:59,622 --> 00:28:01,456
They are monsters, but that
would also make them idiots,

673
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,557
and they're not idiots.

674
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:03,725
Well, what are you
talking about?

675
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,258
Well, they must have
fixed the sensors by now;

676
00:28:05,293 --> 00:28:07,093
otherwise if it happened again,
they'd all go to jail.

677
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:08,695
Well, if they fixed the sensors,
then there has to be

678
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,897
- a paper trail.
- Of course there is.

679
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:11,432
Then all you have to do
is get it.

680
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:13,467
What do you think I've been
trying to figure out all night?

681
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:15,268
What's to figure out?
Subpoena it.

682
00:28:15,303 --> 00:28:18,505
Yeah, there's only one problem.
Harvey only gave me 24 hours.

683
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,640
But now that
you've come up with this,

684
00:28:19,674 --> 00:28:21,207
maybe Harvey
will change his mind.

685
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:23,477
Donna, I have a theory that
I can't prove and an opposition

686
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:25,178
that's shown they're willing
to alter evidence.

687
00:28:25,212 --> 00:28:27,914
He's not gonna change his mind,
and you know it.

688
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:29,515
There's got to be another way.

689
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,685
Donna, look, I appreciate
what you're doing,

690
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:35,555
but unless you have this other
way in your pocket, please,

691
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,425
just leave me alone
and let me try

692
00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:41,094
and think this thing through.

693
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:01,780
No! I don't care what he says.

694
00:29:01,814 --> 00:29:03,282
It's an active
goddamn investigation,

695
00:29:03,316 --> 00:29:04,283
and I'm not gonna
stand around--

696
00:29:04,317 --> 00:29:05,317
You can't talk
on that here.

697
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:06,618
Hang on a second, Charlie.

698
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:08,720
I'm sorry, we got off
on the wrong foot.

699
00:29:08,754 --> 00:29:10,422
Is your name Danielle?

700
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,157
That's what it says
on the plate, isn't it?

701
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:14,159
Well, Danielle, I'm here
to pick up the documents

702
00:29:14,194 --> 00:29:16,354
I ordered an hour ago,
and if you don't give them to me

703
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:17,529
in the next 15 seconds,

704
00:29:17,563 --> 00:29:19,030
today's gonna be
your last day.

705
00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:20,098
You didn't talk to me.

706
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:22,801
I said hold on, damn it.

707
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:26,104
Look, I don't have time
to play "who spoke To who."

708
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:28,373
I am up from DC because,
as it is, these documents

709
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,041
weren't sent
when they were promised.

710
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:31,342
I'm sorry.
What is it you need again?

711
00:29:31,377 --> 00:29:33,545
Oh, Jesus Christ.

712
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:36,381
All the maintenance work orders
from the past six months.

713
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:38,583
I can't let you have that
without authorization.

714
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:40,785
Well, then by all means,
let's call your supervisor,

715
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,521
and we can tell him
how you'd rather play <i>Farmville</i>

716
00:29:43,555 --> 00:29:45,355
than cooperate with me.

717
00:29:49,127 --> 00:29:50,694
Who did you say
you're with again?

718
00:29:50,729 --> 00:29:53,731
Have you heard of the National
Transportation Safety Board?

719
00:29:57,335 --> 00:29:59,336
They'll give you
what you need in the back.

720
00:30:16,587 --> 00:30:18,220
What did you do?

721
00:30:18,255 --> 00:30:20,156
I didn't do anything.
What did you do?

722
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,190
Don't give me that.

723
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:22,926
This makes my entire case,

724
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,094
but I can't use it if
I don't know where it came from.

725
00:30:25,128 --> 00:30:27,163
Oh, that looks like
it came from Liberty Rail.

726
00:30:27,197 --> 00:30:29,699
Oh, oh, yeah,
it just happened to walk itself

727
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:31,768
over from their secure facility.

728
00:30:31,802 --> 00:30:33,736
Well, it's possible that
somebody went over there

729
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:35,704
and released it
from their secure facility.

730
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:38,240
Donna, if I go to Harvey
with this and tell him

731
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:39,475
what I know happened, he--

732
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:41,009
You don't know.
You think.

733
00:30:41,044 --> 00:30:43,946
Don't lawyer me.
He'll never let me use it.

734
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,182
Well, then don't tell him
what you think happened,

735
00:30:46,216 --> 00:30:49,351
because if you do,
he'll make you drop the case.

736
00:30:49,386 --> 00:30:52,254
Okay, right now,
I don't care about the case.

737
00:30:53,623 --> 00:30:55,491
I care about you.

738
00:30:55,525 --> 00:30:59,095
Mike, I didn't steal anything.

739
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:00,996
I talked my way in,
and that's what happened.

740
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,064
Did you tell them
this was discovery

741
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:03,099
for a case against them?

742
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,066
No.

743
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,366
Then it's not admissible
in court.

744
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:06,835
Well, then you
have to figure out a way

745
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:10,138
to use it not in court,

746
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,673
but don't ask me
for my help on that.

747
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,709
I have done enough.

748
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:26,454
Hey.

749
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:28,523
Heard you
wanted to see me.

750
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:30,992
I take it you patched things up
with Louis Litt.

751
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:32,160
How do you know?

752
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,462
Oh, he wanted to know
if you were a sports bar guy

753
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:35,930
or a wine bar guy.

754
00:31:35,964 --> 00:31:37,965
Did you tell him I'm more
of a strip club kind of guy?

755
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,268
You really want to go
to a strip club with Louis Litt?

756
00:31:40,302 --> 00:31:43,471
I don't really want to go
to a strip club with anyone,

757
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:44,805
but I do have a meeting
in 10 minutes,

758
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,840
and it's 15 minutes away.

759
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:47,041
Oh, I just wanted to tell you

760
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:49,477
that I appreciate you
patching things up with him.

761
00:31:49,512 --> 00:31:51,346
There's no need to thank me.

762
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,382
I would do anything
for the woman that I love...

763
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:58,453
Even get a drink
with Louis Litt.

764
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:12,065
You here to talk
about Anderton Software?

765
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,501
Because your 24-hour
Liberty Rail pass is up.

766
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:15,602
Then I guess
it's a good thing

767
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:17,638
that just came
in the mail for me.

768
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:18,672
What is it?

769
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:19,839
Maintenance records showing

770
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:21,708
they replaced the heat sensors
on all of their trains

771
00:32:21,742 --> 00:32:24,178
within six weeks
after the derailment.

772
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:26,480
Now, why would they do that if
they never failed a safety test?

773
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:27,747
They wouldn't.

774
00:32:27,782 --> 00:32:29,516
Which means Joe Henderson
was telling the truth.

775
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:30,816
I can think
of three different ways

776
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,218
they'll explain this away.

777
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:36,289
Not if we can get them on record
before they know we have it.

778
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:38,224
And why don't they know
we have it?

779
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:39,625
The same way I didn't know
they got

780
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,900
Joe Henderson's sealed records.

781
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:42,407
Which means you did
something sketchy.

782
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:45,030
Harvey, do you want to spend
all night asking me exactly

783
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:46,232
what I did or did not do,

784
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:48,634
or do you want
to help me right a wrong?

785
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,307
Donna?

786
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:56,209
Set a deposition
with Liberty Rail,

787
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:59,312
and tell them this time
it won't just be Mike.

788
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:01,146
I'm on it.

789
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:12,676
Who the hell is that?

790
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:14,244
That's the CEO
of Liberty Rail.

791
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:16,379
Yeah, I know who he is.
Who is she?

792
00:33:16,414 --> 00:33:18,048
That's their lawyer.

793
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,849
Why didn't you tell me
she was hot?

794
00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:21,284
Because it's not relevant.

795
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,819
- It is to me.
- Why?

796
00:33:22,853 --> 00:33:24,554
Because she's hot.

797
00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:26,656
You must be
the infamous Harvey Specter.

798
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:28,791
- You must be--
- Evan Smith.

799
00:33:28,826 --> 00:33:30,460
Have to admit,
when I saw your name was Evan,

800
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:32,295
I thought you were a man.

801
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,863
And I have to admit,
when I saw your name was Harvey,

802
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:35,198
I thought you were a man.

803
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:37,200
- I think I'm in love.
- I think you are too.

804
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:38,801
Okay, can we
get this over with?

805
00:33:38,836 --> 00:33:40,337
We sure can.

806
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:42,204
I don't even know how you
have any questions at all,

807
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,305
given our last meeting.

808
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,773
We just have a few.

809
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:50,979
Mr. McIntyre,
before the derailment,

810
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:54,015
Liberty Rail conducted tests on
the heat sensors on its trains.

811
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,217
Is that correct?

812
00:33:55,252 --> 00:33:56,772
- Of course we did.
- And why was that?

813
00:33:56,786 --> 00:34:00,055
We run tests
on all our systems.

814
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:01,390
It's routine.

815
00:34:01,424 --> 00:34:02,758
And the finding of that report

816
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,926
is that there were no problems
with the heat sensors.

817
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,362
Are you going to just
ask questions

818
00:34:06,396 --> 00:34:07,495
that you already
know the answers to?

819
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:08,996
It's routine.

820
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,665
There weren't any problems
with the sensors.

821
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,635
And do you routinely
replace the heat sensors?

822
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:15,002
Yes.

823
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,471
We replace them
every five years

824
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:18,406
as part of our regularly
scheduled maintenance.

825
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,408
And when was the last
regularly scheduled maintenance?

826
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:21,976
That would be
two years ago.

827
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,144
And you wouldn't fix something
that wasn't broken, right?

828
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:27,548
Of course not.

829
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,717
I'm not in the business
of wasting money, gentlemen.

830
00:34:29,752 --> 00:34:32,019
I'm a bit confused.

831
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:34,188
If you're not in the business
of wasting money

832
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:35,956
and there was nothing wrong
with those sensors,

833
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,958
then why did you just
replace all of them?

834
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,559
They didn't replace
all of them.

835
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:42,029
I think we'd like your client
to answer that question.

836
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,900
You're in a bit
of a pickle, Richard.

837
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:47,768
You don't know whether to say
you did or you didn't.

838
00:34:47,803 --> 00:34:49,603
Of course, you could roll
the dice with your own life

839
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:51,038
just like you did
with other people's.

840
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:52,907
The truth is,
it doesn't matter,

841
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:54,408
because you already
said on camera

842
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:55,609
you didn't replace
those sensors.

843
00:34:55,643 --> 00:34:57,644
And we have these.

844
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:09,255
Where'd you get these?

845
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,990
I'll tell you
what I told Joe Henderson.

846
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,360
It doesn't matter
where they came from.

847
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:16,296
It just matters
that they're here.

848
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:17,831
I need to talk to my client.

849
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,299
That's a good idea.

850
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:20,634
You should discuss
how many zeros

851
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:22,035
you're gonna write
on that check.

852
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:23,169
And one more thing.

853
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,370
You're not only gonna
write a check.

854
00:35:24,404 --> 00:35:25,538
You're gonna
write a public admission

855
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:27,940
because people died
in that crash.

856
00:35:27,974 --> 00:35:29,408
That's not how this works.

857
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:35,247
It's how it works today.

858
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:37,015
You're really gonna force
them to make a public admission?

859
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,417
Damn right, I am.

860
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:40,720
- Who are you, Mahatma Gandhi?
- Somebody has to be.

861
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:42,688
You were too busy
demanding a bunch of zeros.

862
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,189
Well, I was just
looking out for you.

863
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:45,824
Those suits don't pay
for themselves.

864
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:46,924
No, they don't.

865
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:50,362
Mike, great job.
You really stepped it up.

866
00:35:50,396 --> 00:35:52,129
Thanks, Harvey.

867
00:35:52,164 --> 00:35:55,166
I think you might be starting
to come into your own too.

868
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:04,475
Really?

869
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:06,109
Every single game?

870
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:08,512
No, just the playoffs.

871
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:10,213
- Two sips?
- Two sips.

872
00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:12,716
- No more, no less.
- Any beer?

873
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:14,385
Oh, no, not any beer.

874
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:15,986
Miller Lite.

875
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:19,523
Miller Lite?
What?

876
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:20,591
But she's a queen.

877
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,693
What can I tell you?
She got it from her dad.

878
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:24,628
Look, if the Giants
are in the playoffs

879
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:26,430
and Jessica doesn't take
two sips of Miller Lite

880
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:27,564
after every single first down,

881
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,699
she thinks they're gonna lose,

882
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,000
and there's no talking her
out of it.

883
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:32,802
And those happen a lot, right?
First downs?

884
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:34,003
They sure do.

885
00:36:34,037 --> 00:36:36,572
So what is she like
when she's drunk?

886
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:38,608
Well, that's a conversation
for another time.

887
00:36:38,642 --> 00:36:40,643
Ooh.

888
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:42,011
I so feel you, bro.

889
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,385
You know, I got to say,
Louis,

890
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,321
I almost feel bad
about pulling that prank on you.

891
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:55,224
Don't feel bad.

892
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:56,959
It was a pretty good prank.

893
00:36:56,993 --> 00:37:01,262
Okay.
One more?

894
00:37:01,297 --> 00:37:03,832
Only if you tell me more about
what Jessica's like at home.

895
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:05,266
No, screw that,
I want you to tell me

896
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:08,336
what she was like back
when it was Pearson Hardman.

897
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,972
Done.

898
00:37:11,006 --> 00:37:12,073
- Hey.
- Hey.

899
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:13,207
You're heading out
for the night?

900
00:37:13,242 --> 00:37:14,776
- In a few minutes.
- Want to grab a drink?

901
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:15,911
Celebrate?

902
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:17,412
- I can't.
- Why not?

903
00:37:17,447 --> 00:37:19,013
Not that it's
any of your concern,

904
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:21,114
but I'm having drinks
with Evan Smith.

905
00:37:21,149 --> 00:37:22,983
What?
You got her number?

906
00:37:23,017 --> 00:37:24,384
No, she called me.

907
00:37:24,419 --> 00:37:25,686
Oh, she asked for your number?

908
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,221
No, she didn't have to.
You gave it to her.

909
00:37:28,256 --> 00:37:29,457
It was on that subpoena.

910
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:31,291
I know what's gonna
be on your subpoena.

911
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:33,594
- What does that even mean?
- You know what it means.

912
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:35,429
Sure as hell do.

913
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:38,666
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

914
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,733
I take it you heard
about Liberty Rail.

915
00:37:40,768 --> 00:37:41,935
- I did.
- See?

916
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:45,304
No harm, no foul,
no mass exodus of clients.

917
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:47,139
I'm glad.

918
00:37:47,174 --> 00:37:48,508
What's on your mind, Jessica?
You don't seem--

919
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:51,110
I know you told Scottie
about Mike Ross.

920
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,152
How'd you know?

921
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:02,755
I didn't till just now.

922
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,591
- Jessica--
- I'm not mad.

923
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:07,259
I just want to know
what made you want to tell her.

924
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:08,728
What difference
does that make?

925
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:10,997
Because I want to tell Jeff
the truth about Mike Ross too.

926
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:12,664
What changed between now

927
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,767
and when you fed him
that Louis bullshit?

928
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:16,568
Nothing's changed.

929
00:38:16,603 --> 00:38:19,905
I just don't want
to lie to him anymore.

930
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:22,074
He told you he loved you,
didn't he?

931
00:38:23,577 --> 00:38:26,213
When the hell did you start
figuring shit like that out?

932
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,016
I didn't
till just now.

933
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,250
Then answer my question.

934
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:33,185
What made you decide
to tell Scottie?

935
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,322
That's not what
you really want to know.

936
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:40,092
What you want to know
is if I wish I told her sooner.

937
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:41,927
Do you?

938
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:45,998
Yes, I do.

939
00:38:57,176 --> 00:38:58,576
Hey.

940
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,812
Hey, Rachel,
what can I do for you?

941
00:39:01,847 --> 00:39:05,616
I just wanted to come by
and say thank you.

942
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:08,386
- For what?
- Oh, come on, Donna.

943
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:11,456
Mike told me
you saved the day.

944
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,957
Oh, well, you know,

945
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:14,825
after I saved those kids
from that burning building,

946
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,661
I had a little extra time, so--

947
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:18,530
Well, then maybe you should
take the rest of the night off.

948
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,763
And why is that?

949
00:39:19,797 --> 00:39:23,600
Because that's what
superheroes do.

950
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:50,693
Macallan 18.

951
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:52,861
You got great taste.

952
00:39:52,896 --> 00:39:54,263
Surprised I called?

953
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:56,765
Like I said, you got great
taste, but let me be clear.

954
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,967
You want to talk settlement,

955
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:00,035
I can't do it
without Mike Ross.

956
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,171
I'm definitely not here
to talk settlement.

957
00:40:02,206 --> 00:40:06,142
Good, because there are things
I can do without him,

958
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:07,977
exceptionally.

959
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:12,548
I want to show you
a little video.

960
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,750
What, did you dig up footage

961
00:40:14,784 --> 00:40:16,018
from my high school
championship?

962
00:40:16,052 --> 00:40:18,053
Because that'll make this
too easy.

963
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:21,957
Afraid not.

964
00:40:21,992 --> 00:40:25,360
That's your secretary
unlawfully gathering evidence,

965
00:40:25,394 --> 00:40:29,397
which means there will be
no settlement of any kind.

966
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:40,109
And tomorrow, I'm sending this
to the district attorney.

967
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:42,209
Enjoy your drink, handsome.

968
00:41:09,904 --> 00:41:11,104
Jessica.

969
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:13,874
Jeff, there's something
I need to tell you.

970
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,942
There's something
I need to tell you too.

971
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:19,980
What's going on?

972
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:22,216
What's going on is
I just had drinks with Louis,

973
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,017
you know, as a favor to you.

974
00:41:24,052 --> 00:41:27,655
Turns out he's not so great
at holding his liquor.

975
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:30,524
- What did he do?
- No, he didn't do anything.

976
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,859
- You did.
- I don't--

977
00:41:32,894 --> 00:41:34,094
You see, we were
actually bonding

978
00:41:34,128 --> 00:41:35,928
when I suddenly remembered
what he had done to you,

979
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:38,264
and I--
well, I wanted to make sure

980
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:40,433
that no one
ever did that to you again.

981
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:41,901
So I asked him
how he found out

982
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:43,703
about Daniel Hardman's
embezzlement,

983
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:45,238
and he started with the words,

984
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:47,574
"It was two years ago."

985
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:48,941
Jeff, I can explain.

986
00:41:48,975 --> 00:41:50,210
You can always explain,

987
00:41:50,244 --> 00:41:52,412
but that just means
your whole story

988
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:55,416
about how Louis got his name
on the door is bullshit.

989
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:57,049
And I came here
to tell you the truth.

990
00:41:57,085 --> 00:41:58,652
More bullshit!

991
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:00,152
Then let me tell you now.

992
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:01,487
Don't you get it?
We're past that now.

993
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:03,055
- I don't want to know!
- Jeff--

994
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,090
In fact, I never really
wanted to know, I just--

995
00:42:05,124 --> 00:42:07,125
I just wanted you
to tell me.

996
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,960
But now, no matter
what you tell me,

997
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:11,463
I won't ever believe
it's the truth.

998
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:12,797
Jeff, let me in.

999
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:13,998
It's over, Jessica.

1000
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:16,034
It's done.

1001
00:42:21,774 --> 00:42:23,775
We're done.

1002
